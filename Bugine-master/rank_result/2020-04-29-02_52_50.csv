com.google.samples.apps.iosched,107.4,1,402,"Sluggish and insanely slow!! Won't remember where i left off, start screen takes forever to load and has no useful information. All in need is schedule, and takes me several taps to reach where I wanna go. It doesn't even check the date and time to show me the event I am looking for, takes me right to first day 9 am, but hey, its the 3rd day!!!"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,76.25,1,281,"I paid for this and now it's free. Typical bait and switch. Now they want me to pay for in-app unlockables. This is literally a crime. How dare you put ads in an app I paid for and features I paid for behind another pay wall! I paid for a lifetime ad-free license. At least give us a code for removing ads in the app you thieves! ""We need ads to stay afloat"" what garbage, 50 million plus downloads. I don't want to hear excuses! I'm contacting Google."
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,75.9,2,280,"This app is a disappointment. The first release was not functional to reserve seats and even with the updates it crashes frequently. It was exciting to hear about the new ""AI first"" mindset at Google, it would have been nice to see this implement something intelligent (e.g. show near by events/activities, stop showing past events in list, etc)."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,74.05,2,287,Bhutan I would have rated 4 or 5 stars like others but since i live in Bhutan and there is no district except for capital Thimphi included in it... i would rate it 5 star if the maker of this app includes all the district or places in bhutan not just thimphu alone...
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,72.5,3,274,"Gave me notification spam, pestering me about some inane part of the app when I wasn't using it. Immediately uninstalled. Developers need to be punished for abusing the notification system (and using it as self-advertising). More and more apps are doing this and users end up drowning in constant useless notifications, and it will only get worse until people take a stand or app stores have to formulate stricter rules regarding them."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,62.05,2,221,"Good, but battery hog Fast & free. Good functionality. Not as complete as some others when it comes to smaller roads and lanes. But it is a good app that I use regularly. Great for displaying KML routes without a data/Wi-Fi connection. I use it to display my planned bike routes while on the road. BUT, the most recent version is burning through my battery, even while I'm not using it! Today without even running the app once, it used 33% of the total battery usage for the day. That's a problem."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,61.9,1,226,"dear Maps.me administration, I hope you realize that after your latest updates, you've added an nonexistent country to your map, I'm talking about so called ""Nagorno - Karabakh Republic"" which is not recognised by any nation in the world, and considered as a part of independent Republic of Azerbaijan 🇦🇿. those territories are under occupation, which happened after brutal war with armenian separatist. Showing ""NKR"" in your maps, is denying 4 UN resolutions which are demanding to end occupation."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,58.9,2,218,"Pixel 2 (Stock Android) Feb/2019: Looks promising but app rarely works properly. Even while traveling abroad, Google Maps Offline worked great but MAPS.ME Offline did not work at all - couldn't even find my location, let alone use navigation. You may have a different experience than I did but I cannot rely on it, and hence, will not recommend it. Hope they fix the issues."
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,58.75,3,219,Love it but where's my schedule? Update: I still do not have web and app showing the same schedule.               I set up my schedule already online but when I log in to the app it doesn't show any of my selections.
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,57.5,3,220,"The app is amazing, maps are amazing, just been to Venice and was really happy with it. There's only one problem. The GPS doesn't show you your exact location, it shows you a location in a 300 meter radius from where u actually standing. If you can fix that, I'll give 5 stars"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,57.25,2,203,"This app used to be perfect and previously helped me navigate around the world, but after updates these last few months, the app will no longer work offline. Unless I am connected to wifi, the app hangs on the preloading screen logo. Consequently, the app is now useless to me. If I wanted an app that required data and pressured me to to turn on location services, I would use Google Maps. This is disappointing because this used to be my go-to app."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,55.35,3,197,"It used to be good and still is for basics but: 1) offline navigation instruction completely wrong. The voice says to go straight but instead you need to exit the motorway on the right. 2) rerouting takes too long time most of the times. The navigator keeps on following the route it expected despite the road I took is wrong (for the above mentioned reason). 3) expected time of arrival... the calculator is really negative at the beginning but optimistic after a few km... if I plan a 200km road, the first time indication is about 4hrs (or anyway higher than any reasonably possible time). After 100 or 120km, despite I'm still missing 80km road, the expected time of arrival drops to 1 minute.  Driving with your app has become hard!"
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,51.0,3,200,"It's 2018 and this suggestion is still ignored: There should be some kind 
"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,49.5,3,158,"I was a bit lost on a tropical island's hill. Used it to find the right path back. Recent version seemed to be acting perversely, sending one to slip road to exit motorway only to rejoin it. Also no option for using motorway if available. Not good. Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid. Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button. Another feature absent is any indication of the name of the road you are on, or, often, the junction numbers on motorways. The maps do not always show road names as well, or if they show up, the names will vanish when you zoom."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,48.05,2,165,"USED to be great !... now it's too complex.. it auto updates unwanted aspects you have no control over ...you can't stop it... and so now I feel that it's invasive on my privacy ...I don't trust it anymore I'm strongly considering uninstalling it. once again , someone took something that worked , made it ""better"" and ruined it ! it's like some unspoken law!!!"
org.stepic.droid,45.9,3,164,I have a problem with opening videos I just get the error that there is no connection while I am connected to the internet and I'm sure about it. Please help me I wanna use the tutorials but I can't. The deadline for the course is closed.
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,45.4,2,164,I cannot attend in person. I wish I could filter the sessions with video. All three days are a giant scroll fest. It's hard to compare sessions when you have to scroll up and down this much. I just registered for all just so I can see them in my calendar. This is a great example of how to make a complicated animated UI that makes everything difficult for the user.
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,44.35,3,171,"Gets the job done, rough around the edges And through the middle. Crashy, resets view every load, just feels buggy and unfinished"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,44.0,1,140,"Suddenly failed to run After the latest update today, I can no longer use the app! I don't need the latest features, please bring the app alive! I have reinstall rebooted a million times, doesn't work! The app is simply dead and doesn't launch."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,43.9,1,148,"This app used to be great! Now it just crawls! I'm trying to plan a trip with various stops & I can't even get it started. I want to throw my device across the room! Very sorry it has gotten so unusable. EDIT. Finally the speed picked up, yet it tells me there is no way to get to certain towns where the road is clearly marked and Google Maps has no issue. They take no responsibility for routes not working because they are using some other company's maps. Removed."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,41.95,1,151,Liked it!!! But recently experiencing problem locating my current location offline.......if this issue is solved i'll give 5 star
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,41.7,1,150,"Was good, now invasive. I do not want popups asking me if I have thought about where I am going this weekend. Deleting it now. Remove this idiotic nonsense and I will reinstall and re-rate it."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,40.25,3,139,"Love it with a few hicups Good app but has a few issues... 1: When updating the app I loose all my downloaded maps, why not have the app download them for me or perform an update on them. 2: After an update I loose my customised locations. 3: I want to be able to find my destination using coordinates not just names of places... 4. It seems to give prescidence to highways even if they a longer route, this isnt a good algorithm... Otherwise its a good app... I love it and use it daily."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,38.45,2,123,"I also agree that the app does not work as it used to. Previously you would enter the street number, name and town and it would come up but it now just gives multiple options none of them what you want nor does not give any reference to the town other than the main capital city which means you have to enter everyone until the correct one is found. It used to be a very good app and I used it constantly overseas but now I cannot as I cannot trust it will get me to where I need to go. I tried the OpenStreetMap you mentioned in the previous post and it gives me no option to tell anyone nor does it bring up the requested address."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,36.7,2,128,"So inaccurate and unreliable! It was the cause of MUCH frustration when walking in Barcelona and Seville. It seems to perform better in cities laid out on a clear grid but beyond that, it's pretty useless. I absolutely would NOT use this app for driving navigation. To be specific, the location arrow is very slow to respond and it often indicates the opposite direction of actual travel. Next, t here seems to be a 'sweet spot' for reading the street signs when zooming in to pinpoint location."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,36.05,2,123,"Voice guidance is awful: says keep right/left where I have to go straight, doesn't say exit numbers, doesn't say street names. Search is poor: shows the list, but how do I check these places on the map. I click the place and it shows my current location with the option to route to, but sometimes it shows the destination, go figure! No alternative routes, not optimal route, it can give the route which includes traffic lights, a couple of left turns instead of short residential road and right turn"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,35.1,3,122,"handy and accurate, but the search function only gives exact matches which is tricky when traveling in foreign countries, and it gave me a notification explaining the bookmarks feature after I'd already bookmarked several places. Minor but annoying"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,34.95,3,107,"Adds have been added in one of the never versions, don't update if you haven't already! It's a good app, but it's NOT a universal map. It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options. The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing. Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system"
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,33.0,1,108,"The schedule is terrible. Going to event details and back resets your scrolling position. There are way too many events for this simple list representation and filtering doesn't help much. Search is a joke when you try to find a session because there are many of them with the same name and you have to go to details to see the time, the list is not sorted by time either. Shuttle bus schedule is missing from the app so you have to go to the web version to see it."
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,32.1,1,114,"Schedule not changed The schedule view stopped on  18,19 and 20 May"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,32.05,1,103,"I do like the feature of offline maps and being able to put down multiple locations pins to save specific locations, however I am not able to even look up specific locations... When I type in the complete address for a house, the map only shows how to get to the entire street, which some roads can be very lengthy, and not to the specific house."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,31.7,3,112,"I had high hopes for this app but it's been disappointing on many occasions. Despite downloading the required maps prior to losing internet access, they will not load when I am out and about without internet access. As soon as I am connected to the internet it comes to life. What's the point advertising the app as an offline maps app when it doesn't actually work that well?"

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,29.65,3,99,"I started using this 2 years ago, and it was very good then. With recent updates the quality of routes for pedestrians has declined sharply.  I was recently in Manchester and could see my destination 100m down the street, yet maps.me wanted me walk 250m round a block. It was giving me a driving route, although I checked, it was set to pedestrians.  The version of a year ago was better for walking."

I end up spending a lot of time correcting my text instead of writing it ! New block editor is even worse and you're forced to use it, difficult to switch it off. (Samsung SG8 updated, Gboard up)"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,28.95,3,101,This app is very good if you need a map while not connected to the web. This app has a long way to go. Update: I have had this app for sometime now and they have done a good job making it better. I find myself using it more often than when I first purchased it. I would go 3 1/2 stars if I could.
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,28.7,3,88,"Great tool but runs horribly on my phone at least - even after latest bug fix update. Super laggy to open keyboard on search, freezing and crashing often. Sometimes zoom buttons are missing or not in their usual screen location."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,28.0,2,92,Became worse It was excellent light app. Now it shows map quickly but does not respond to touches approximately 10 secs. Phone is hot after a few minutes of using. It shows hardware OpenGL requirement. My phone does not have opengl. But one year ago app worked perfectly without that.
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,26.45,2,93,"Kept erasing sessions App kept erasing my schedule, including events in the past. This prevented me from rating sessions attended since they closed that time slot after it passed, as well as forcing me to resort to screenshots for each hour block. Erasing seemed most frequent when rotating device, but still did it with rotation lock on."
org.wordpress.android,26.0,3,76,"I love this app except for the fact that is 1) crashes all the time and I cannot post to my sites 2) blanks out after spending lot of time writing a post in it, then loosing all of my work because it blanks out when I hit publish and it hasnt saved 3) the worpress admin panel is bad to utilize. Most importantly, you loose the ""user"" functionality. i know it says""people"", but you have to send an invite. you cannot creae the account 1st, then send the invite using WP panel."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,25.8,2,70,"three extremely annoying features: (1) search option is poor, useless. It doesn't even find objects marked in the map. If it finds, it actually displays another object! (2) the most disturbing are automatic updates, after which all the downloaded maps are gone. This makes the app useless without internet. (3) after an automatic update, all the bookmarks you have carefully stored for your travels are erased! There us no way to prevent these automatic updates that delete your saved maps."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,25.6,1,82,CHEATS DON'T BUY! I Paid for this in the past. Now they want more money. The understanding with Google and developers is that you only pay once. This is wrong. Please do not support this behavior. Your response does not change the fact that I bought an ad-free version.
org.wordpress.android,25.55,2,75,"I was super impressed with the app up until I went to edit a published post, the app wasn't updated and showed my blog post as it's first orginial draft? All my edits and revisions since then are all gone. It was considered a draft again and unpublished. That was days and days of work disappeared within seconds. I will no longer be using this app."
org.wordpress.android,25.35,1,75,"This latest version no longer lets me share an article from a web browser into a new post. It always gives me a blank post where, before, it set the post title to the article title and placed a link to the article in the body of the post. This app is pretty useless to me until it's fixed."
org.stepic.droid,25.25,1,83,I can't even create an account. The app sends push messages relentlessly trying to get me to create an account even though it won't accept the information I'm trying to give. It's not worth the hassle. Try a different app.
org.wordpress.android,25.25,2,81,"For an official app of one of the most popular blogging platform on the internet, it's not very friendly or responsive to changes on the web version. One, none of my pictures could be uploaded to the media, and two, deleted websites still remained in the list until I finally figured out how to remove them, yet it didn't do it cleanly. Never changed for years, probably will uninstall finally."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,24.65,2,81,Unable to find location Today actually to get the some route I had installed this app. But the famous place in hyderabad chilukur balajai temple was not found which is my destination place. Dear team kindly add some important places such that it can be used locally also..
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,24.6,2,76,"Address search function doesn't work Not sure if I need to toggle online capability or what, but search can't find business names or many Street addresses. Sucks when trying to navigate when our of town."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,24.5,1,80,Downloaded this app to use on a trip. It clearly said I had the offline map downloaded yet when I entered in the exact address or a category.. It said zero results found even though I knew the address was within my downloaded map. Poor experience. I reconnected with at a McDonald's and only then did the address show up. If this app requires you to have data then google maps is better.
org.wordpress.android,24.4,2,74,"Change the profile pic from the app was successful,new pic applied in WordPress web based,but in the blog owner comment reply list the blog owner gravatar still using the old previous profile pic,I wish there will be select all in Comment menu so user can select all spam comment n delete at once.Why if we change public name it doesnt change all the previous public name in older comments with new one!?the Reader tab have issue it still showing me content from blog site i have unfollow for months!"
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,24.2,2,78,The app reservations didn't work. UI/ux is sub par as doesn't auto scroll based on time. And I'm surprised Google didn't use nfc on phones instead to have passes than having to wear this leash around my neck.
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,23.9,3,76,"Just a small bug Everything is good except its heat problem. When I run other apps or even play modern game , my Xperia Z5 get warm, but when use this app for more than 10 minutes , my phone getting hot that I feel it's gonna explode and I close the app immediately ."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,23.8,1,76,"Spamming with useless notifications.   Not only that, then they lie about it. No its not the same for other apps - NO other app spams like yours and I certainly wont disable anything in the OS just because you decided to be lying spamming bholes."
org.wordpress.android,23.65,1,61,"Nothing works anymore, posts don't update, stats, even the apparent external website fails to be recognised! This used to be a much better app for being able to blog. It's now useless and can't be used. You have to use desktop for everything to work the way you want it to. Disappointing."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,23.3,1,74,"I purchased maps.me when it wasn't free and now this app wants me to pay for removing ads from ads-free app which I already purchased. Google, can you please ban this developer?  RE: It's up to you how you spend money which you received for my purchase. It was not 4-year subscription. It was a lifetime purchase. I do understand you are doing fraud here - sell application to make it add-free, then make it free and return adds back to get money from advertisers after you got money from customers which wanted to remove adds. I'm going to report to Google about this issue and ask for a refund at least."

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,22.6,1,64,Maps.me was great until it completely crashed when I was in the middle of Chile. I tried restarting the app and restarting my phone several times with no success. Even uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work. I was happy to use the app until it just stopped working at all. I will use another offline map.
org.wordpress.android,22.45,2,47,"The app regularly crashes as I type. It freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often. The app fails to recognize letters as I type them and it deletes spaces after words. A solution is to work in html mode. It appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post. The more images, the worse the problem. It seems unbelievable that WordPress, with its QA resources, can't fix these issues."
org.wordpress.android,22.2,1,54,"This app feels like it just keeps getting worse. If I start a post on mobile, it keeps default saving to local which then creates post conflicts pretty much daily. I have comments and pingbacks enabled, but if I start a new post on my phone, they're disabled for that post...and those options can't be accessed via mobile so I have to use my browser to go to my post and manually set those options to enabled for the new post. It's so broken that it's become mostly useless for me to even use."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,21.95,3,73,"It's fine. It seems unfinished sometimes. The lack of street names in the voice navigation makes it hard to use for navigation unless you have someone with you to be the navigator and tell you what the app is showing. The lack of street names also makes it unusable for navigation on my motorcycle where I depend solely on the voice prompts. To clarify, the streets were named in the app, and they even flashed across the top of the screen, they just weren't spoken in the voice prompts."

I didn't find anything is the settings to prevent app from doing this when not running. As a result, I had to decline obtaining location using Android permissions.

I pushed the button to publish, and Wordpress immediately said it could not publish. (Not sure why, b/c my internet connection is fine.) It didn't save the post, the whole thing is gone, up in smoke.   This app might be good for a Buddhist who wants to work on not being attached to his/her posts, but as far as a blogging app goes, if it doesn't save your posts and loses your hard work, then it's crap.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,20.4,3,62,Big issue. I have this big issue that Is very poor of this app... I was driving and it took me through footpath though on car and I got stuck on the way and had to leave my car and continue on foot since I didn't have any other option... I suggest you integrate Google maps in this app because it can't find some locations like my church. I had to use Google maps and bookmark it in this app before I couldn't get lost anymore but the other problem is it deleted the bookmark without my permission..
com.google.samples.apps.iosched,20.2,3,72,Today I have download this app but I didn't able to change the date. It showing same Month and date. I think they did much better for this app.
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,20.2,2,68,Map should have been updated years ago. I should update the map? How is that even reasonable for someone travelling to a region they haven't been to (I'm assuming all the maps are out of date)
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,19.5,1,48,This used to be a good app. Now it refuses to update the routes in certain parts of the uk and now is impossible to use to get to anywhere but the 4 places in the country that can be updated. I used this for work and now its totally useless. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but its exactly the same. If this isn't fixed I'll be deleting the app permanently. At this moment in time I would not recommend this app to even my worst enemy (yes it really is that bad!!)
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,19.25,1,53,"Last maps update is a disaster. Can't update a thing, mentions lack of space due to limitations of Android 4.4 (I'm on 5.1 and have a 64GB card set as disk writing destination) and on it's own adds a list of Caribbean islands to the download list."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,19.2,1,42,"Downgraded from 3 to 1 stars.. After a year or more of using it.. It's got the potential to be an excellent / the best cycle gps in the play store.. For cars there's hundreds of apps, and for this it does fine just like the others. But for bikes there's hardly any decent apps at all. This app shows many tracks you can't find on most maps, let alone GPS navigation.. For this I give it 5 stars.. Problem is, even on great Wi-Fi,  trying to choose a bike route you'll need huge download speeds and half a day to get a route over a handful of miles show on your screen... But if you've got a mountain bike and want to cycle through farmers lands on tracks you never even know existed then this app can and will take you on them.. Just don't use a road bike....and be prepared to cycle more as it will try to avoid all main roads, though you can't choose how your routed.. I've ended up walking in knee deep grass and climbing rocks with my bike in the UK and Brazil using this app in the past.. But I like that.. now however, it doesn't even load up ..I really want this to be my main cycle gps  .. Gave one star to try get developers attention..."

It has no idea where I am when my location is turned on, when I'm in a car it can't decide whether I'm going north or south. It can't pick up the hostel I'm staying in so last night I got so lost thinking it was showing me back to my hostel. It was late at night and had an awful time trying to figure out where I was going"
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,18.55,3,45,"Has some UI usability issues. While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results.  Also, no way to enter a street number. Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!   Disappointing. I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.   Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!  In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed.

Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.

Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started.

First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask! Alright, first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!), and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"" and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work. ""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that. On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device.

On first use it misses a connection to a highway and suggesting a longer route. Then the app even tries to send me back three times unnecessary, making the journey even longer. Vocal directions are ambiguous compared to my regular Garmin nav and compared to Google. Maybe it's just the dutch language. At times the GPS update seems out of sync with the actual location.

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."

You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.

I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.

What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error. error.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,10.65,2,1,"Too many ads. Even more than Google Maps. At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.  EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable. I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched. This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing."

Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that"".

I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images.

This is a serious deficiency and rules it out as a useful tool for me. It couldn't even find the city I live in, and I was literally 2 miles from it. 2) Routing is SLOW. This makes my decade old tomtom seem speedy. 3) Route time is WILDLY inaccurate. Over 7 hrs to drive 200 miles by highway? YGBSM 4) No apparent way to get an alternate route. I couldn't even find any way to force it to go through a waypoint. (Another deal breaker for me.) 5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable.   The good: 1) Really nice maps. The best I've seen. 2) Useful info on POIs including hours, phone, website, etc. is great. 3) Can use national level overview maps with cities and interstates without any download.  This would be good if all you want is pretty maps with no routing. I may keep it just so I can see where in the world I am while flying."

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,9.55,1,1,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take."

I was kind of expecting to get some response. Alas - no one came back to me. Here is my original bug report:  1 - the maps are very good, with very aesthetic and appealing view. Kudus! 2 .- I have received few times failures in planning a walk, and was advised to define a different start or end point.  I fail to understand both. 3. There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn. For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants. 6. There should be integrated icon explanation. 7. I would expect a search that yields many results to sort them from close to far. In 99% of cases I need the closes"

I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count.

ANSWER TO THE DEVELS: yes of course i checked my GPS location settings, i believe i made myself clear: this is the only app that gives me trouble, even other GPS apps are working correctly. Please next time, read carefully the review instead of assuming i did something wrong. 2SD ANSWER TO DEVELS: I will try to be even more clear: I checked all the settings of the phone, i only have that problem with your app. Btw, there is a more critical problem: it cannot find a route to a lot of destination, an international airport in my case. 3RD ANSWER TO DEVELS: Unbelievable, for the third time: YES I CHECKED ALL SETTINGS! Note that i read your FAQ. This is the only GPS app i know that cannot route you to an international airport and i had the same pb with addresses on public roads. 4TH ANSWER TO DEVELS: no i am not contacting you, i use a better app and our exchange was unpleasant, it is enough."
