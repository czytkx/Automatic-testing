32.3,2,108,"V4.4.09 crashes regularly and still missing foundational features... Update: 8/10/13 -  Dropped rating one more star. New version 4.4.09 now crashes regularly when multi-select deletes are attempted in ""Unified Folder"". The app crashes probably 60% of the time when I do a multi select then hit ""delete"".  Prev. Issues still there:  1) Basic feature on BB since day 1 to delete email local/server/both not available in K9. You're forced to pick one option in settings (Delete On Server or Delete on Handheld or Mark All as Read on server). This needs to be set by account, or on an email by email basis.  2) It also still can't handle meeting invites through email."
31.8,3,110,"Used to be the best mail app I used but it's quite buggy with Android 6+... Major bug is syncing is erratic - sometimes works, sometimes doesn't unless you disable battery optimisation for the app to exempt it from Doze. Minor bug is sometimes old read emails gets marked as unread. Some aesthetic update wouldn't hurt like some icons."
26.5,3,96,Like it so far No fault in the app but Google has blocked me from signing into my Gmail account because this app doesn’t meet the security requirements. Sure that’s just an excuse for them to get me to download the Gmail app.
24.4,2,74,"Sadly, K-9 is no longer up to the task of it's main function. I've used it for many, many years but since Android 7 it's failed me regularly across three phones. Mostly this means it won't sync mail status nor deletions on some accounts. It will simply disable sync and not let it work again even after removing the account and re-adding. Removing and reinstalling the app shortly results in the same failure. It hasn't been updated in too long, so I put the blame there. Good bye, sweet K-9."
24.05,1,77,The UX is pretty bad but I use it because it supposedly is privacy-friendly. But the app doesn't fetch my messages! Edit: not reliable at all as it rarely notifies me of new emails no matter what email service. UNINSTALL
23.9,3,82,"Would be 5 stars if not for frequent sync issues (it will say ""syncing disabled"" frequently though I have settings so that it should be syncing in the background all the time so as to not miss important emails when they come in) and often trying to send emails with any sort of attachment, regardless of attachment type or size, the emails will get stuck in the outbox for several hours and on some occasions even DAYS. Definitely room for improvement."
21.45,3,77,K-9 Mail is having trouble when OpenVPN connect is activated.  All other apps and web sites work fine.  Even when the VPN is then disconnected on LTE the problem persists.  Moving next back to WiFi the problem still persists as well.  Only a reboot of the phone seems to help.
21.0,3,74,"Good email client, but there is few very uncomfortable moments. 1) When I try to star message in list(star button placed most right side), then it's like roulette - will it star message or will it activate hidden scrollbar and fling somewhere me in a list. 2) Message grouping is not good enough. Many messages that correctly grouped by gmail will not be grouped by k9"
20.3,3,70,Defacto is a bit disappointing It's a well known mail client for a long time - almost the defacto standard for 3rd party Android mail clients perhaps. But it feels like it needs an interface overhaul. Just feels a bit dated and stale. Functionality is good but for me I found connectivity to exchange by owa far slower than other clients I've tried. Also it seems unable to deal properly with nested folders. Some folders I've been unable to see at all.
19.15,2,65,"SORT THE SYNCHRONISATION OUT. PLEASE. IT IS LITERALLY THE KEY FUNCTION OF AN EMAIL CLIENT -LETTING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NEW EMAIL. I should not have to manually check. Taking another  star off because comments are being ignored. Also, what's with the new - and rather babyish - logo? The original was rather smart. Can we have it back please?"
19.05,2,61,"Seems nice but ... sync disabled. I've set network settings backward sync to be ""Always"", and folder poll all and poll every minute. But the app shows synching disabled. I have no idea how to get it to check mail automatically, which makes it kind of useless."
18.75,1,57,"Actually, it is a very good email app. The new icon totally sucks and the main developer seems to be completely deaf to users feedback about it. Don't be fooled by the icons you see on the Google play page for k9. It isn't showing the new icon.  Even if the old icon doesn't come back, the icon needs a different look from what it is now."
18.6,2,52,"Push mail has not been working reliably for years, always leading to the error message ""Syncing disabled"" and tp delayed incoming mail. Why K-9 disables syncing remains unclear. Other email clients, like Thunderbird, do not have any such problem. K-9 also has too many, too complicated settings and some user interface problems. Apart from these problems it is good."
18.1,3,66,Oldfashioned. Needs polishing very much.
17.9,1,56,"On Android 8 there's every other time ""Syncing Disabled"" (though manual sync works) makes app unreliable and by that almost unusable. @dev: It's not your bloody job to decide when to sync. Just _try_ it *each*and*every*time* you're supposed to sync."
17.85,3,53,Encryption features get better. One important one missing though: Should allow to save messages unencrypted if the server is trusted.  This option is crucial for more user friendly work.   Also: opening messages got quite slow since some updates ago.  If both issues were solved it would be 5 star!
15.65,1,47,"How the Mighty Have Fallen - used to be my go-to app for email on all my Android devices, but since I upgraded to an S8+, the app no longer syncs my mail. Checked the dev forums, this issue was reported but the devs closed the ticket as ""will not fix,"" so the app is essentially useless to me now. Good job shooting yourselves in the foot."
15.25,1,43,"used to be good, but now all I get is internet unavailable. I try all the encrypt methods to no avail."
15.1,2,38,"Little problemette since phone updated to Nougat, K9 keeps showing Syncing Disabled.   Have to maually synchronise email . Pity, as Iove the app. I've, been using it for several years on a Samsung SIII,  Sony Z4. Not found anything that gets close to it for versatility and functionality.         .K9:  V5.206      Android: V7.0      Samsung Galaxy S7   Just retried K9 (V5.600 Android 8.0.0), hoping the ""Syncing Disabled"" error was fixed, but still displays the message and fails to update email.  Very sad, very disappointing.  :("
14.75,1,41,"It's a shame. First Kaiten does a bunk, then K9 trashes its icon and the dev(s) refuse(s) to listen. I stuck with it for months but along with the synch problem I eventually trashed it for Bluemail. It's not my K9 but you cannot continue to insult folks with that flippin' icon. You are asked to submit bug reports rather than one star reviews, fair enough, but the carp icon is not a bug and no one's going to convince me that the dev(s) are not aware of the hostility to that icon so why bother? On top of that, the Play Store entry uses the good ole K9 dog icon? It's dishonest."
14.6,2,42,"K9 Ver 5.208 Samsung S7.  Been using K9 for several years on older S4 device, loved it.  With newer android K9 will not reliably get email.  Mostly I have to manually request it.  I have tried several of the claimed tips to fix it. I had hoped the claim of the problem being fixed for this version was true.  Nope, after a couple of days use, not fixed.  I'm tired of fighting it.  I really wish it was fixed but I'm wasting my time with it."
14.05,2,41,"Use to love K9 Mail.  But ever since about 2 updates ago, I just can't take it anymore!  It takes like 5 seconds or more for the email to display after you attempt to open it.  There are some other small annoyances with the latest version also.   Hopefully they'll fix the issue but until then it's another all for me."
13.85,1,41,"Broken since the update. There is a profile that keeps coming back. QR scan 
"
13.4,2,36,"Used this app for years but recently it stopped syncing. Despite background syncing is set to ""Always on"" it says ""syncing disabled"" or when kept open it counts down the minutes to the next sync but doesn't sync afterwards but instead says stuff like ""next sync 1 minute ago"" when the countdown would have hit negative numbers. This is true on both of my phones, sadly. I don't even know what to replace this app with - please fix it. :/"
12.95,2,39,Don't working after new update! It was one of the bests in the Google store but after new update the vpn conect to server but nothing happen at all ...disappointing! Please do something to restore your reputation and take my five stars!
12.95,1,29,"2018 UPDATE, K9 STILL DISSABLES SYNCHING. NO GET EMAILS AUTO, DISSABLES SYNC AT LEAST 3 TIMES A DAY. NOT SURE WHY THEY CANNOT FIX. MAYBE IF THEY CONTACT BLUE MAIL APP, THEY HAVE IT FIGURED OUT..   Warning, will not work with nouget on phones or most  tablets, not sure why k9 will not fix. Problems, sync dissabled. will not poll or  sync emails unless  manual refresh since phone 7.0 nouget update. Can not find workaroud on samsung s7 edge. Not sure why k9 is not fixing. I HAVE CONTACTED K9 DIRECTLY, NO RESPONSE. not sure why they r ignoring all the sync related complaints. Too bad. It was a great app for years. Looks like people r recomending switching to blue mail app with no problems. Please advise"
12.35,2,39,"The new look is so ugly. Pure white text on pure Black background just hurts my eyes. Please tweak the color to something more plesent (just check the dark color scheme for text editors) or at least provide a ""light theme"" option."
12.3,2,34,"Please go back to the old icon or allow the user to pick which icon is displayed.  The new icon is terrible.......it doesn't even look like a K-9, which it should.  I have had small issues with the app in the past but they have always been resolved (Thank you!) or a workaround found but I refuse to have that icon on my main screen.  I will happily change my rating after the icon issue is resolved."
12.05,1,29,"5 star reduced to 1 star.  It was bad enough when Ctrl-A would open the address book rather than Select All.  Now Ctrl-C is broken.  Rather than Copy, it pops up some stupid dialog about encryption.  What's next?  Will Ctrl-X summon Wolverine and Ctrl-V vacuum my floor?  Tried using the requested Bug Report site but that was just a jumble of developer speak and not at ALL end-user friendly."
12.0,2,34,"Won't sync with my Gmail accounts over open wifi networks. Every time it tries to I get a security alert and a recorded login attempt from somewhere random within the United States. This does not occur with my other non-gmail account. This issue has persisted for a year and has never been fixed. I put up with it for a long time, but now I'm switching to Blackberry Hub, which handles Gmail just fine. No other email client I've ever used has had this issue with Gmail."
11.8,3,36,"I'd like to use it but... Seems it doesn't want to accept my works email exchange account. Keeps saying a valid url for the exchange account could not be found. It's funny because plenty of other email apps don't have a problem. And why are the time and date on the emails so far behind the actual time and date? Get it sorted, K9!"
11.25,1,27,"Used K9 for many years but now notifications totally not working on Android 7 Galaxy A5/2017. In spite of settings configured to notify of incoming emails. Have to dump this and use Gmail app, which notifications work ok.  Latest v5.208 still not working properly. There's still no email notifications when any email comes in. The only way to know if there's any new emails is to manually open the app."
11.25,1,21,"Worked fine for years. As of most recent update, no more push emails, I have to actually start the app and then force it. Always displays syncing disabled no matter what I do in the settings. Really sucks because this was always the best email app. It is useless right now, and I will have to use some other app that isn't as good if it doesn't get fixed. Are you listening?"
11.0,3,28,"Not the best, some weird design ideas have been implemented. Where's the empty trash, or spam. Selection looses the read/unread visibility, makes it hard to distinguish one from another. There should be swipe to delete or mark read, etc. Other than that, it reads emails ok, has great level of detail for headers, the choice of colors is questionable and wpuld be better if I could select my own bg/fg for any content. Notifications while useful, don't work properly, as mark as read or delete buttons never actually do anything. Hope it will improve."
11.0,1,20,"Sync is disabled, unable to re-enable it. Cannot adjust battery optimization settings for this app. App gives notification that it's made for an older version of Android, I have Android 6.0.1. Developer must have given up on updating this app which sucks because I used it for years before."
10.6,2,32,kcp is gone after the update. have to uninstall and find an old version!
10.3,3,36,"The best open source email client for Android. Been using it for ages. 
"
10.25,2,21,"Used to be great and I used to love it. But it's become increasingly unreliable in the last year. It drops messages (they're sitting in my inbox on other computers, but k9 never gets them), it doesn't synchronize the read and archived status to the server for hours, it has trouble sending emails, and sync never works (always disabled) It was a great open source project but I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere now. I appreciate all the work the community has put into the app, so long!"
10.2,2,28,"Very Sad So recently I've been having problems with K9 mail and despite my best efforts it still persists. I have had problems checking my other accounts on it after checking one of them, for instance if I check one email account and then try to check another the program just hangs. I have to clear the cache and force a stop for it to work again. So that being said I'm switching."
10.05,1,21,"Almost impossible to use this latest version 5.403 Very Laggy, takes long time to schroll down and open message. Problem exists even after I recreated the data.  I have been using K9 for the past 4 years with multiple accounts on the same phone without this issue."
10.0,1,16,"I've used K9 for years on different phones, it's a simple app and straightforward to setup and use, always been happy with it. Recently installed it on a new phone, and syncing is disabled. I've tried everything I can to try to fix it but to no avail. From the looks of many posts online, it seems the developers know there's a problem but aren't in a rush to fix it. So I'll be using a different email client from now on."
9.95,3,25,"UPDATE: Wow, the new icon is garish!   I really enjoy K9 Mail, but I keep getting notifications on my Gmail accounts that someone has my passwords. Until I started using this client, I never had a problem. I'm worried because you have to choose less secure settings in Gmail that it makes my accounts vulnerable to attack."
9.85,3,27,"Installed on my s7 Samsung edge, works well but will not poll automatically,  says syncing disabled  ?????  Not sure why they can not fix it. I filed a trouble ticket online but it was ignored. My guess is they can not figure out the syncing disabled problem.  JUST FOUND A POSIBLE FIX ON  FORUMS. TRYING NOW ....."
9.55,1,25,i i need to change my mind sucked
9.5,3,28,"I've been using this classic E-Mail client since first getting an Android Phone. It's feeling a bit dated these days, with no update in over a year. It definitely needs one for Android 10."
9.45,1,3,"New Version as of 9/26/2014 is BROKE Just received Ver 5.000 and I nolonger can access my email accounts.   ""Certificate Error"".    Lets get this fixed.  It never asks to get a certificate, press next and it says ""Connecting to server"" and then it ends.   The good news is I can send & receive emails, but when it polls is when I get the Certificate Error notification.  I have tried your suggestion, but it doesn't work.  Your app now on my phone,  constantly posts ""Certificate Missing"" .  And with that, your app eats my battery up.    So I have uninstalled your app.  I need my emails and whether I post here or on your link on google that I can't find where to post a problem, My post will remain here.   I have tried reinstalling, and it failed again.   I really think your product applicaton is really great, but since the last update, its been a disaster.  So I have moved to a different email client.  You can post here if and when you fixed the problem."
9.45,1,9,"2 problems since recent updates In Accounts when you select an individual account options pop up. I used to select ""clear messages"" to remove all local messages, since 2 updates ago this has ceased to work on both my phone and tablet. Appears to do so but size does not reduce. Tried to find link from K9 its self to report but end up with host Github. It would be good to be able to report errors from app without spoiling feedback for this great app. Back to 5 stars when fixed."
9.25,1,1,"Good app but very bad data usage I've installed this app a little bit more than a month ago. I was generally happy with it but I've noticed however that it's eating my data usage allowance like crazy. Since the 1st of October, according to my phone, it used around 475MB, without counting the half a GB it used while I was in wi-fi!!! I don't receive that many emails to justify that, absolutely no way! Since I use other apps as well that use internet connection, I'm now near the limit of my 750MB monthly allowance and I'm afraid to use my phone.  There is a 'data killer' for K-9 to control data movement but that doesn't work for my phone, the gs3, as you can read from the user reviews. So, there is really no solution around it.    I first tried to raise a call with them about the lack of sync options in K-9 and how it's increasingly consuming data and the Data killer thing doesn't work! They replied to me that what I'm saying should be logged under 'enhancements' and not 'support' so they disregarded my log. Yeah, right. I'm going through their 'logging' process for something I consider a bug since they don't want to listen.    I'm uninstalling the app when I get home"
9.25,1,19,WAS good :( :( :( Used K-9 for several years. But lots of issues lately...and not syncing correctly. Made me miss some really important emails. :( :( :(  Was the best email app...but now I'm going try some others.
9.2,3,28,"Like others have found, K9 has become a bit unreliable. One very infrequent annoyance is K9 suddenly ""stopping"" and closing while drafting an email. All text in one's draft is lost, no interim saved text available to fall back on, unless one had wisely saved the draft at a previous stage. Utter, utter rubbish! Therefore I avoid writing long emails in K9. Otherwise K9 would be a really function-rich email client app (as promised in 2017)... but until then...when? Where in 2019 now, heading fast for 2020!!!"
9.05,2,21,Goodbye K9 Sad to uninstall K9 as I have used it for years. I like its visual approach among other things. But its become buggy/unstable and now I am faced with syncing disabled and no way to fix it. Emailed support and was directed to the manual and G+ community. No fix in manual and post to community asking for help unanswered. Had no choice but to make the switch to another email client for android. Sorry K9 but I guess all good things end. Bye!
9.05,1,17,"Feb 20: All deleted emails appear twice in Trash. Have reset account, doesn't help. Frequently get Can't Send Email messages and can't poll folders first time, Class Cast Exception. Also, for some reason polling often misses out folders, even though they're set to poll."
9.05,2,27,No PRINT support! I can print from my mobile to my local networked printer via cloud service .. just not with K9.
9.0,1,18,"Won't work on gmail accounts unless you check to ""Allow less secure apps"" to run on my phone. That means ALL less secure apps run automatically if I just want to allow k-9 to run a gmail account. Either the k-9 developers need to make their app more secure to pass Google's standards or Google needs to let us individually choose a ""less secure app"" one at a time to run versus just doing a blanket ALL less secure apps can run just to allow k-9 to work."
8.95,1,13,"Update 6/2019: K9 frequently slips into ""Syncing Disabled"" and I have to manually pull emails. May be time to move over to Aqua Mail or something. Works well, better than my default (S8+) email app. That being said, it still likes to download emails from my server even if already opened and deleted from phone, K9 downloads again."
8.85,2,19,"Used to be great I haven't been all that impressed the gmail's app as of late so I went on the hunt for different mobile email client.  And for a while, K-9 was it.  It did everything I wanted without clutter.  But with a recent update, it took a turn for the worse.  My biggest beef is with the way they now handle multi-select.  I like to just click an icon on the left and select an email...then click another and so on and then move/delete/etc the whole batch.  But now if you click the icon on the left it asks you if you want to add the sender to your contacts.  This is something I almost never feel the need to do but it's apparently one of the easiest things.  To select an email you no how to long-press on the email and find ""select"" in the menu.  Turned one of the easiest and most commonly used features into a chore for me.   Moving on."
8.75,2,21,"Update (June 2017) stopped synchronizing.  Lowered my rating, but not yet uninstalling. /// Update  (Dec 2015).  Still by far the best email client.  /// (2013) I have used K9 for several years for my non-gmail account.  The current official version is 4.409, and it is excellent.  However, today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developer's site, 4.512, and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance.  Even in comparison with Gmail.  Wow!"
8.75,2,27,"No PGP/MIME Only inline PGP supported. This issue is 3 years old according to your Git page. 2 stars and not 1 because inline is a nice start :) Rest of the app seems to be non-tablet, a pitty."
8.6,1,14,"This app used to be great. I have used it for years. Now it has been terrible. Keep getting ""sync disabled"". And it has started to give me ""authorization failed"" on some of my accounts. Have deleted those accounts and put them back. They work fine for a bit then gives me the ""authorization failed"" all over again. After this happening too many times I am giving up on K9. Maybe someday all this will be fixed and then I will give K9 another chance. Until then it no more."
8.6,2,18,"Neither of the two issues highlighted ago has been fixed 😐 Tapping the star on the right hand side in list view will cause the list to scroll. Also, progress bar when downloading an attachment would be welcome. Half the time I get the impression nothing is happening, and often nothing actually is...nevermind guys, switched to AquaMail, it's like moving from 2006 to 2015. It was nice while it lasted."
8.6,1,20,"After a long time of great results using this app it has now suddenly become useless! Permanently stuck ""upgrading database""  Even now 8 months later the latest update still has the same unfortunate results!"
8.55,1,15,"Bland design, missing several key features like retrieving mail from the trash too. Cmon guys, it's 2018 I've seen Netscape mail in the 90s let you drag messages from folder to folder. News flash: Account type has nothing to do with moving local messages. Stop being lazy and stubborn and enable it on POP accounts already."
8.5,1,4,"Drains battery, Eats data, Push doesn't work. Program looks promising, BUT in reality it is plagued with problems and bugs. The main one being for some reason it constantly connects to the server(s), eating bandwidth and battery life. The only way to stop this is to disable background sync completely, which results in NO notification of new emails at all. Tried using with 2 gmail accounts on GS3 (ics 4.0.4) and while network sync was enabled it would just constantly stay connected to gmail servers using data, causing the phone to heat up, and the battery to drain insanely fast.  Google the problem, you'll find TONS of reports and NOT A SINGLE WORKING SOLUTION :( sad because I really liked the way it formatted emails on the mobile screen, but its not usable because of the battery drain alone and the constant eating of data bandwidth 24/7.  And I'm trying to use it with GMAIL - not some odd or off the wall email service."
8.4,1,6,". After years, STILL ANNOYING! Does not seem to be in development. And does not work with Google two factor authentication. Messages load SLOW, trigger to swipe to next message is far too sensitive so trying to see what is off screen turns into swiping-confusion, creates phantom labels, i.e. ""[Gmail]/Sent"" ""[Gmail]/Archive (The internet does not seem to know why). Also, the rules for mail fetching suck, e.g., the timeframe for accessible messages, even through manual calls, is limited by a hard setting...which makes absolutely no sense. On top of it all it has a horrible icon and name....typical Google.   Relented and went back to splintered use of native Gmail and Mail apps, which sucks in its own right. I want to give it two stars, but that's just one less star to make up for all the BS 5 star reviews."
8.4,1,6,"Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data — hardly ideal —  but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is insane! Having persevered with this for years, I've now given up, uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store."
8.4,3,26,"You could have flattened the icon without making it look like the awful one you have thrust upon us. I understand what you've tried to do and doing so would have made it better than the old one, but this attempt is just awful. Please find a designer who knows what they are doing."
8.35,2,23,It was very good and connect easily by 3g simcard or home adsl but not working than one month age in Iran
8.25,3,23,The app is not compatible with Android 10 (eats battery like crazy) and the new beta version has horrible UI. :-(
8.15,3,25,"Great email app, been using it for years, but the new icon?  Absolute rubbish, it looks like it was designed by a 5-year-old, actually a 5-year-old could do a better job I'm sure"
8.05,1,7,"*EDIT!! Moderately new bug!!!!!* Usually LOVE this app - ALL I use, for MANY years ... but major problem with last update!! Outgoing emails will NOT send unless I'm on wifi (3G and 4G working fine, but emails won't sent, get stuck in outbox until wifi goes on (getting notification saying problem sending this email). Usually goes out perfectly fine once on wifi. This is a NEW problem!!  ****I'm hoping the makers will see this review and fix this*** PLEASE!!??"
8.0,1,8,"Not respecting poll settings I have added an email account that I don't have access to anymore, but I'd still like to have the emails available. Therefor I changed the account settings to never poll the server. Since the last update this doesn't seem to work anymore. I am constantly reminded that the authentication failed. Can you fix this please?...still not fixed after last update. Will give it 5 star when problem is removed."
7.95,2,19,"Upgrade broke it Has been a great email client, but recently a lot of persistent quirks - doesn't show my most recent mail, although they show up in notifications. Now keeps telling me my server settings are wrong (no changes except the upgrade), and the application keeps stopping.  Goign to have to change over to some other IMAP email app."
7.95,2,19,"Major bug for several months now - does not sync/update reliably. Sometimes it does, but sometimes it does not sync for hours until I manually force it. Totally random. Have missed dozens of important emails this way. Now looking at the alternatives."
7.95,1,15,"Used it for years, until it stopped syncing after switching to Android 8.0. No solution or workaround for this problem. It became useless, I will uninstall it and search for an alternative."
7.8,2,16,"Can't see attachments!    5.203 has two big problems. Messages load slow, real slow. And the attachment is now indicated at the bottom of the message not at the top.  So you can easily miss it. This is a deal breaker for a default email client."
7.75,1,7,"Been great until three days ago and it just stopped working. Rebooted phone. Reinstalled. Nothing. It goes to load messages from hotmail and the progress wheel just spins and spins...nothing. UPDATE - never got a response from the developer. But tried it again later. Quirky. Some messages just do not come through at all. it has actually been some very crucial ones as well. The current problem I have, is now, after I read a message, it disappears, deleted from stored messages. Very Very bad."
7.7,3,22,Basically good. But it's getting unstable recently. I'm currently in China. It doesn't work on my laptop and even Sometimes on my phone.
7.7,1,2,"Annoying First it got my settings wrong (how difficult is it to check correct settings for Yahoo?) then created the account anyway with incorrect settings, so I ended up with three copies of the account. When I said never poll, it still polled the first time, and locked the app for several minutes trying to download hundreds of messages. It appears to have no setting to leave incoming mail on the server (a pop3 feature which has existed for decades) so the most recent messages now only exist on my phone (the very reason I asked it not to poll, and the reason I have already deleted the app). It kept downloading messages when no poll and no sync had been requested.  The other major feature missing in my native email client, intelligent recognition of phone numbers and other details in mail bodies, appears to be partially implemented, but selecting a number doesn't show you what you have selected, and doesn't prompt what you want to do with, it simply takes you to the dialler and pastes the number there.   Have no idea what it does with email addresses and URLs but I don't want this app anyway."
7.7,3,4,"I had used k9 for many years as there wasn't another email client nearly half as good or efficient, but the latest update has introduced a number changes that make it significantly slower to use. Bring back the ""mark all read"" in notification pull down, and let us disable warnings such as confirmation required to""mark all read"" in main window. I think these two things will cost me half an hour a day managing my email on the go, that is 3 weeks in a year, I will check back in a few months if these are back. Update 5023 improved and fixed a few things, notification area still needs work, it's hard work trying to get the right message to show the options so you can delete or mark read when each has its own set of options and even Gmail doesn't split the options or message, change for the sake rather than good functional design, thanks for listening on the other things though."
7.7,2,18,"Used this app for years, but i'm going to install it and use another app. Why? Because it says ""syncing disabled"" for most of the time so no mail is being retrieved automatically. Apparently they are not doing anything to fix this. A shame for such nice application as it used to be."

I switched to Blue Mail and love it. Uninstalled."
7.6,1,10,"8 years ive used this app. now I'm over it. repeated tickets have been raised for the continued syncing issues. repeated blame deflection from user fault to android/power issue. just admit you can't fix it. one of your developers public posted they're aware but repeated reports aren't helpful. that was a year ago and yet the problem remains current. some people might like an app that can't poll unless you tell it to, but if it's supposed to, and doesn't, that's something that needs fixing!"

Yes, I know there's an option to store to the external card, and I have it switched on, but on my phone, internal storage is called sdcard0 and the external card is called sdcard1.  K-9 does not seem to be able to differentiate between the two, and, thus, over a gig of emails are being stored internally and taking up valuable space.  There needs to be an option to let the user specify the storage path."

I tried minimising fonts but has not effect on Account title bar.  Over the last few months when I fetch messages, it downloads old messages from months ago that have all been read and some were deleted. Went online to my mail provider and selected All messages as read even though they wete showing as read to be sure. Made zero difference. Still randomly get 10 to 20 very old emails already read or deleted in my inbox. Very frustrating. Also have 2 yes 2 trash boxes in same account. I have 4 accounts all have 2 trash boxes. A deleted message is duplicated into each trash box. I have to delete both. Also when I write a message and send it creates duplicaye message. One is sent the other is duplicated again and placed in each trashbox. Seriously a pain. installed on both my Android 6.0.1 LGG4 and 6. 0.1 LGG5 and both do this. Please fix"

7.3,2,14,"Used to be great Alot of great features. However it has issues with email syncing and it can drain your battery unexpectedly.

I hoped that it stays on my phone for ever but the recent sync issues have been a problem for me.

Not sure if it was the 2nd update or not but it is working much, much better so far. No force closes. I am wondering if the short cut I had on my homescreen may have been linked to the old version. Not sure. Either way, this is a very nice looking improvement.  The updates have helped but it still force closes every time I try to delete multiple messages.  Although this has been updated several times, it still has not fixed the problem with deleting multiple emails. It will allow it once or twice but then it force closes.  It is a shame because it is a good app but it is just too buggy to use consistently!"
7.2,1,0,"Liked it until Update I got K-9 because the default mail client was broken from day one. The default client changed the content and / or to: addresses when replying to an email.   K-9 initially was great with my IMAP server.  I made the misteak of letting it update, and I don't need, but can live with all the UI features it added.  But I can't live with how the new version messes up my IMAP account, with messages showing up on the phone, but absent from my PC mail clients.  Today, it created a mail message with no content and no headers, leaving me to wonder if there had been a message on the server that got deleted by K-9.  Time to downgrade or find another client."

When I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S4, K9 would not allow me to send from the outgoing server.  I screwed with this for two days.  I got onto K9 designer website and found a step by step on how to pull a code that will tell them what was wrong with their program.  I had to download a code reader program, open and program the settings to their specifications, then had to open the code reader and scan, open K9 mail, try to send an email so it would recreate the code, and the code reader would recreate the code. Then I had to plug the phone into the computer, download a certain file, then mail it to K9.  The code reader ran for a full 24 hours showing nothing, before I repeated the process.  I sent K9 Mail support team a detailed email about my trouble, then said to, ""can you please respond within 48hours with a solution, I use my email for work and will be on a out of state trip in two days and need it, if you cant respond I will have to download another client and use their services"".

I installed K9 on my moto x yesterday and it was easy to set up.  Today I noticed that the emails on my PC did not match the emails on my moto x... some were missing from both; in other words if I have K9 running, the incoming emails go to K9 but are not duplicated on my PC email. Not good. I need ALL incoming emails on BOTH my phone AND PC. I looked though all of the settings - no help. I went online and tried for two hours to get help from K9... I am technically savvy, but getting help from K9 is impossible.  So unfortunately I uninstalled K9 and reinstalled the stock app that I don't like, but it works as it should. Thus the one star.  If I could have accessed some help without wasting my entire morning I would keep that app and give a higher rating. K9, if you're reading this please contact me and help me!"

I took the time to explain the situation thoroughly in an email to the developers via the link to contact them on Google Play-- except turns out that only gets you a canned response to go to their Github forum.  So I did that, took the time to create an account, and explained my issue there. It sat for 3 days and got no response.  I went to their Google+ forum, took the time to create a Google+ account, and posted there. Got no answer.  I went back to Github and bumped my thread, got an irrelevant answer from someone that didn't solve the problem, and he immediately closed the thread. So, this was great while it lasted, but it's impossible to get assistance when something isn't right.

6.65,2,3,"Good email app; battery drain As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. It's flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with.  However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of ""keep awake"" time (even though I hadn't opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that I'd used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the ""keep awake"" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU.  The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I don't know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not.  I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - I'll probably give it another try."

6.6,1,0,"Could be a lot better One of the reasons I stopped using K-9 Mail a while back is because I check multiple accounts throughout the day but I like to have it automated. I wanted an email client that could check my email accounts at certain times of the day, like every two hours, between certain times of the day, like between noon and 8pm and no other times. This can't be done with K-9. You have to set up each email account to check every so often, say every two hours. If you check like six accounts, you have to change these setting for each account and you can't dictate a specific time but only the time frequency. For example, if you want to set all accounts to check at 8pm, you have to wait until 8pm to set the first one and by the time you're done setting the last one, it's way after 8pm. This feature should be in the Global Settings and have the ability to over-ride the account settings.   Basically I want an email client that works the way SnapperMail works on the Palm platform. Another thing: I can't seem to ever save any kind of attachments to the SD Card, even though the button is there. When I tap on Save, I get a message that states my attachment can't be saved."
6.6,1,0,"Cannot trust any Android mail app ...not even this one, though it seems to be the best of a bad batch. Do not use K-9 if you have more than a few hundred messages in your email system. Kept throwing NULLPointerExceptions, I imagine they were triggered by 'too many' messages. In any case, use of IMAP is hindered, because the app seems to try to read the whole messages prior to showing them in the folder, even if you tell it not to. On a fast internet connection, this was gonna take hours to show the thousands of emails in my inbox. Search options seem limited... search whole messages, or... ? Whole messages then. Other choices were too complex, eg too many options for whether or not to display folders. If I made a folder, display it. Use the alphabet to decide where. Done. Make options for things that matter. Good luck for the future. I uninstalled. Will make post-it note to self as reminder: do not trust a platform for email which is provided by a monopoly who makes their money from reading your email.

I have tried the different options suggested. Nothing works. The only option is to get rid of this software. I use an ASUS Transformer Prime."
6.6,1,0,"Was 5 stars until last update--now pgm is broken Was working great on Motorola backflip until last update. Now most emails come in with ""no subject"" in subject line and no text--have to force download of each message's content. Also can't get get rid of error message of ""sync disabled"" and unable to send messages. Please fix or will be uninstalling program soon!"
6.6,2,10,"Latest update makes it a PITA to get my mail. It says its ""loading"" them but it just hangs. Tough to be more useless as an email app really. I gave 2 stars because I used it for years and has always worked great. Uninstalled."

6.55,1,1,Update made my e-mail impossible to use. I have been using K-9 for the last couple years and have liked it just fine.  Two days ago my phone was automatically updated and now I cannot get into my e-mail.  I use it for three different accounts.  My phone searches and finally force closes or freezes up.  I restart my phone and try again but no luck.  I did notice another update yesterday that helped a little.  I am able to get in and delete unwanted e-mail (sometimes) but cannot actually open messages before a force close.
6.55,2,5,"4.011 problems with viewer when opening email I had an earlier versions of this and it worked great (downloaded ~ 9/2011). However, in current version when I click on an email to view the message it jumps straight to starting an email reply. Incredibly annoying. Can't scroll from one messsage to the next easily in this mode either.   Icon on homescreen no longer indicates number of new messages.   Is K-9 supposed to work with my LED notification light on my phone? Mine doesn't.   Please fix it - it was great before!"
6.55,1,1,"New UI messed up display, need to play around to get things readable. Played around with settings, but cannot get decent views with new UI. Can no longer see senders name, had to change font to tiny size but still not enough room. All font sizes have been messed up display looks awful. Have startedk tweaking font sizes in settings, but everything is gine before, why should 1 upgrade cause so much damage?"
6.55,2,11,"Help! I've been using this app flawlessly for the past 2 years for my Penn State webmail account. Then on March 3rd, I suddenly stopped getting mail. Tried uninstalling and reentering settings but it said it couldn't connect. Help please. It might be the update for the OS on my Galaxy s5."
6.55,2,5,"Really wanted to love it but last couple updates really screwed it up. HUGE lag when getting emails, date sorting is wrong, crashes when adding attachments to emails, sending errors.. all basic email functions that should just work. Sorry"
6.5,1,14,新版太难用了，不能扫描，kcp不集成了，而且填写方式也变了。需要单独下载扫描软件与kcp，还有建议取消滑动删除。很容易误操作，删掉再填写特别麻烦，特别是带kcp参数的。好像udp转发也有问题。
6.5,2,0,"Do not like updated version. Buttons at top on new big phones not good. Share hard to get to and not availiable in message list view. Scroll cursor in the way of star botton. Try to star a message and scrolls instead. Phone numbers not clickable or hyperlinked. Bad deal for a cell phone app. All these things are very frustrating on the Galaxy s5. All worked great with old version on Evo 4g. Use them all the time and makes me want to find a new app. Have to also get emails sent to stock email to call, then go to K9 to fight and share."
6.5,1,2,Disappearing Email I've been using this program for years.   Recently my phone gives me a notification that I have new email.   I go to my inbox and see the new email and then it disappears.   I'm set up using Imap and the email client is GoDaddy.  Godaddy blames the phone or K9.  The on board email program don't do this.   I log into Web mail for Godaddy and the disappearing email is still in my inbox.   There is a syncing problem.   Searching the Internet I find this is a problem.

6.45,3,5,"Tried it again, but still buggy I really, really want to like this app. It has all the features and customizations you'd want. The settings aren't exactly user-friendly, but they can be learned. The biggest problem is how slow and buggy it is. It drains battery, takes forever to load imap messages, and kills the CPU. I keep downloading it hoping it gets better, but no luck. Uninstalled again..."
6.45,3,17,"Fantastic app, but recently stopped polling for new mail in the background for me. Very occasionally works. Always polls immediately on opening though. Moto G4 android 7.0.

Can't complete simple actions like deleting emails. Any mail you accidentally delete is gone forever because you ""can't move or copy messages not synchronized with the server"". Blue mail is faster and actually works! Don't waste your time or energy on this p.o.s"
6.35,1,5,"Used to have problems with synching the device after 'idle' mode, but I could always force it through manually. After last update, synching works on Gmail but my Hotmail account won't even manually synch anymore. I'm over it. Time to find another email app."

6.3,3,8,"Was fantastic, current version needs help... I've been using this mail client for years, and it was phenomenal.  However about 2 or 3 updates ago, it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message, with the rest of the screen just a blank white space.  More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem, but they haven't managed to kill it yet, making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes.  Back to webmail for me, and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!"
6.3,1,0,"Horrible syncronization Overall a simple email app that needs more clicks than what is really needed. Not bad, you get used to it. The main problem is it is absolutely horrible with attachments and syncronization with mail servers. For example, attachments can take minutes to load if they ever do. Partial emails are frequent. Images are almost always corrupt or not showing without alot of tampering. When you delete in the app, the server doesn't get the call. When you check email on your computer, it's still there. Not happy!"
6.3,1,0,Update killed it Used to work perfect and now I get force closes and can't send even after a complete reset the after hours of tech support I tried added the account back into k9 while leaving the old one still in k9 and it sent an email once then crashed again deleted all accounts and added them back and again some send some don't no matter what hour outbox says it looks like it sent but never get delivered anywhere.. I this is only on some accounts for the mail account.
6.3,2,10,"Always loved this app and gave it five stars, but now Push mail only works if I manually refresh.  I depend on not having to manually refresh day and night.  Had to install Bluemail, which handles Push mail beautifully.  Update: Push mysteriously started working again.  When it works, K9 is still the best.  But now I'm keeping Bluemail on my overworked phone in case K9 fails."
6.3,2,10,I have a problem. Before when you deleted a message or you moved it to another folder. You could then view the message properly in that folder. In the last two versions you cannot any more view properly messages in another folder if you added one unless you resend that folder from scratch which is very annoying.   So the application got recently a lot lot worse..
6.3,1,6,"Got me beat! Spent hours trying to get this to work with an imap account. I could get each folder to download messages once, but the moment I would do a refresh, all messages disappear and no joy ever getting them to redisplay again. I suspect the sync mechanism is badly broken based on my Google research. Running on a Samsung Galaxy S8 FWIW"

It also sometimes loses messages in composition without saving a Draft.  Switched to Blue Mail, which is missing some features important for POP3, but at least works."
6.25,3,15,"It has a nice interface. The new desktop icon is downright UGLY! They still are unwilling to address the issue with Gmail two phase authentication. If you use Wi-Fi, expect to be notified by Google that your sign in was blocked. UGH get your head out of the sand and fix it."
6.25,1,7,"This app does not meet Google's security standards. To use with Gmail, you must authorize account access for less secure apps; that doesn't sound like a good idea. I searched and found a 2-year-old ticket about this. Not sure why this app is around."
6.2,1,8,"Disappointed with the inadequate authentication security. Google blocked my login attempts while initializing the app and sent me a Critical Security alert. Since this is an ads-free app, I'd be very interested in trying it again if the developer(s) bring the authentication security up to Google's standards. Giving it only one star because I cannot even evaluate it with it this way."
6.2,3,16,I've used this app for several years and the fact I could easily set it up for multiple self hosted accounts was initially what drew me to it.  Lately I've noticed all too often connections are not released on the server end and due to that ill have to ditch K9 for something else. If that issue could be resolved I may come back

However, this time the program wouldn't even allow me to complete the setup without getting an ""Auth Plain"" error. Rechecked and tried several more times..no joy. Can't even reach support to request assisance. I'll be uninstalling and finding an alternative."

However I don't get notifications upon receiving new e-mails nor do the appear in the inbox unless I manually click or motion for a refresh. I initially didn't care as I wanted to avoid using mobile data but I am now getting more data and don't care when I am on WiFi. So I activated background sync when auto-sync is checked ( which it is)."
6.199999999999999,1,2,"Uninstalled after update Was a great app but ever since the update, I keep getting certificate errors even though everything is configured correctly. Very annoying that my notification bar is filled with these false positive error messages. Also I noticed my battery drains faster because of always getting the errors. I uninstalled and did a Google search for top email clients and moved over to Blue Mail. Couldn't be happier and no more stupid error messages!"

I played with the poll and folder classes and still continuously uses data and the phone is getting hot. Nice features except for the endless sync part. Mobile data uses a lot of battery, so if this app continuously sync for hours on end the phone will only last for couple of hours. UNINSTALLED"
6.15,1,3,"Completely broken on Galaxy Note 8.  Emails take forever to send, notifications NEVER work, meaning that this app is not fit for purpose.   The final nail in the coffin is the complete lack of user support via EMAIL.  The devs expect you to just ""ask around"" at Google Groups, so I'm done with K9.  If you have a fairly recent device, use ""Aquamail"" instead.  It's a better app and the dev actually helps via email."
6.15,1,3,"""update"" someone's idea of improvement Seriously?  The latest update is just crap.  Never has so little been billed as so much.  Did someone actually think this was an improvement?  Not.  Update - more and more updates, and clearly ignoring the feedback of others.  It just keeps getting less user friendly with every ""update"".  Developer's reply, ""you can download the old versions""  Seriously?"
6.15,1,3,"UNINSTALLED: Hoping that this would be a good replacement for the email client that came with the phone,  However, when I tried to set it up, both Google and Yahoo servers complained about the lack of security.  Software states that it will not connect to HotMail.  Sorry to uninstall this one,  looked like it was feature rich, and besides ... I like dogs. :)"
6.15,1,9,"The app is great, but the new icon is so darn annoying. It's brigt red color screws up the look of my phone that I really have to concider looking for an alternative e-mail client. The main developer does not seem to listen to peoples feedback, so for me he can just showe this app up somewhere far, far away.."
6.15,1,9,Had this since it first came out and it has been great until Android v7 now it constantly keeps having synching disabled. Even tried white listing in doze and that didn't fix it. Is it game over?

Many hours go by and my emails are not delivered to my smartphone, until I open the K-9 app and pull down on the screen from within inbox or click on the refresh button at bottom middle of screen.  I've spoken with my ISP which also manages my email server, and they have no answers. YAHOO WORKS VERY FAST ALWAYS, but I don't want a yahoo email address for my business.  I've selected EVERY POSSIBLE option under  SETTINGS_ACCOUNT SETTINGS and SETTINGS_GLOBAL SETTINGS  My smartphone is a Motorola Turbo2 Android with the latest updates AND I RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS last week, including adding a 128GB SD Card for extra space. The phone itself has 32GB, and the used space so far is 12 GB (8GB.for the system files).  I've complained for years, but no solutions have become available.   Switching to another app soon.

Thought I'd try it again: Nope. 1) error about working with Android 10; 2) won't authenticate with Google for my Gmail. If you don't work with Google on TWO levels, What business do you have making an Android app? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Edit: just got an email from Google saying they blocked an unsecured attempt to log in to my email. WOW. You know it's bad when Google blocks someone else because of security!"
6.1,1,4,"Now, slower than ever. 3/6/2014. well, if I was originally unhappy with the new ui at (4.4), I bit the bullet and went with it anyway.  Not sure of my version, but my k9 auto updates, and for about 2 months, now dog slow (apology to dog lovers) with no setting changes on my part.   Now looking for alternatives. Great, to good, to below avg, to poor over 5 years."
6.1,2,8,"Latest version is bad. 5 stars prior to latest version - now 2 stars. The latest version introduced many bugs. You can no longer zoom text. Delete a message causes app to crash. Scroll to previous message causes crash. It seems to always end abruptly. There are probably more problems, but I don't want look for them."
6.1,2,14,All my emails disappeared! As the title described I have lost all my emails a week ago. No setting was ever changed. I even reinstalled to v5.002 (latest) but still to no avail.

6.05,2,9,Latest update please undo What would make you think there would be overwhelming interest in adding the return email addresses of all the junk mail received to the contact list?  More over why that in place of the select button that allowed us to delete a group of emails concurrently?  I don't have time to open and delete each unsolicited commercial email I receive individually... guess I'll be looking for a new email app in my spare time again.  &lt; frustrated Sigh!&gt;

6.0,1,0,"This app stores email passwords & usernames in plain text in preferences_storage database. I verified myself & (after using an online base64 decoder from a 1sec google search) my password was there plain as day. What this means: ROOTED PHONE: any app with root access, or person (or malicious software) using your phone now has access to all your email passwords. NON-ROOTED PHONE: All it takes is an adb backup (requires pluging a usb cable into phone) Or, malicious software using exploit to gain root access to file, stealing passwords. K-9 Mail isn't only mail app with this vulnerability. To test if your passwords are vulnerable: re-start phone, access mail app. If you are able to download & read mail without entering any password, your passwords are VERY vulnerable. But also, even if you have to enter a password you could still be vulnerable depending on how the app stores your passwords. More research would be needed at that point."
6.0,1,0,"Reboot problem I've had the App for years and have been happy with it. Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3. After the update, my phone started crashing/rebooting about once a day. I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T, and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9, rebooted my phone, and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days. So, while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5,  it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed."
6.0,1,0,"Just uninstalled I like the new interface.  Nothing wrong there.  Been a user of K9 since I got my Motorola Droid phone & loved it.   But - the new update resulted in updates that were slow.  Seemed to slow my whole phone down to the point where performance is unacceptable.  I use some Zedge tones for my ringtones and they stopped working correctly.  While I can't point to why and prove that K9 had anything to do with it, they work again after my uninstall & reboot.  Sorry guys - just can't recommend."
6.0,1,6,"Reply ability gone in landscape The reply button no longer exists in landscape mode? Seriously?  Also if someone sends me a group email and someone else replies, you more stick all those messages together in a folder and only show the most recent reply in my preview?

K-9 shows that it stored it where you wanted, but browsing for the file, it keeps storing it on the phone and not the sdcard. So great, I try to open the pdf file that it saved and it errors out saying the file is not valid. So.... free or not; if it doesn't work it's still crap. UNINSTALLED"

6.0,1,0,Configuration fail After not connecting correctly the manual exchange options were not clear and did not seem to work when they should have. After tracking down some obscure path needed owa\auth\logon.asocials the sync would not enable even after a few settings apparently defaulted off were changed it would not sync. Apparently this lacks push also opting for polling at user defined intervals but I wouldn't know if this actually worked. I might.
6.0,1,0,"No longer a fan - avoid I used to like K9, but due to recent updates, it crashes about 20 times per day, and likely has some memory leaks as it brings my phone to a crawl. I go into settings > apps and manually stop its proceses, and it is like getting a new phone. I also submitted a bug regarding the public key crypto support, which never got so much as a reply (*months* ago). I hope this app gets fixed up or goes away. Switching clients."

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and also did a factory reset on the phone but the notification messages continued so I have uninstalled the app."
6.0,1,0,Broken since June They tried to get cute with new useless features and broke message reflow when you zoom mail. After months of waiting and the official bug report never even being updated I've moved back to the standard Android email app. It is surprisingly good nowadays. FYI the PGP in k9 mail never worked right anyway. So don't install this app thinking it will buy you anything.
6.0,1,6,"Decent app, but it always stops syncing randomly, then I have to open it, close it, open it, close it, then it says syncing is disabled(?) then I close it and open it again a few times and it starts resync'ing.  Simply stopped working on Nougat. I never syncs until I manually open the app. Useless mail software. Time to move on to a competitor, this looks like abandonware."
6.0,2,10,"Pretty basic app, used it for quite a while.  Fine when it works but too many issues.  Syncing is unreliable.  Emails occasionally just disappear, nowhere to be found, after working on them for lengthy periods.  The forum to address issues is also the worst in my experience, no search function to search for solutions.  Looking for a replacement mail app."
6.0,2,10,K9 was one the best mail app but Android Doze in Android 7 made it unfortunately unusable. Polling and push mails both don't work anymore even if you exclude the app from Doze. Google overdoes the battery saving and K9 got killed by it. :-(
6.0,2,10,"Used to love this app, since the last major  update emails take over 1min each to open, imagine checking 60+ emails per day like me! , when I check and clear emails it doesn't clear the app notifications any more. Android- Google Nexus"
6.0,1,6,"Deleted Sorry k9. Have used you for years but you are no longer reliable (doesn't fetch or send often, blank page on opening messages etc). Now that Gmail can link to hotmail there is a better alternative."
6.0,2,10,"Worked perfectly for a while, now synchronising is disabled all the time. Sometimes you can manually sync, other times it fails. Hopefully the developer will address this issue as I want to keep using it."
5.95,1,7,"The app refused to accept my (correct) email settings, and also could not (despite the description of the app) be configured to save emails to my external SD card as promised, which was the only reason I installed it in the first place. A disappointing waste of space and time. I have since uninstalled the app."
5.95,1,7,I have used this application for years and loved it. Unfortunately with the syncing disabled issue popping up on my S8 and happening continuously I can no longer afford to use it. When it worked it was great.
5.949999999999999,1,1,"Battery drain and other issues with most recent update This most recent major update has caused a number of issues which must be resolved:  1. Considerable battery drain (much more significant than prior version). My battery can't even last a day as a result of this upgrade.  2. More frequent crashes/force closes.  3. Application now really bogs down phone. Incredibly slow at times.  I liked previous versions, but have uninstalled this until it is fixed."
5.949999999999999,1,1,"Used it for years together with K@t Mail. Removed both of them in time because they lack consistency. In particular a) many times I don't get notifications when I receive work mail, which ended up with me losing countless jobs. B) often outbound messages won't go through, delaying answers, including the apologies for the missed mails. This made me lose a few good customers, too. Shifted to another product."
5.949999999999999,1,1,"Last version upgrade is awful I used to love this app, now I hate it. With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders. It crashes and doesn't remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app. Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox, other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason. Very frustrating since it was much better."
5.949999999999999,1,1,When there are images in the body of the message fit to screen makes all the texts of the body very small and the image is full width of the screen.  This makes reading the content very difficult since it is so small. I am using Samsung 6 edge. Worked perfectly on Samsung s4. The 250 maximized font size is ignored.
5.949999999999999,3,9,"Used to be great.. then I had to switch because of wrong dates (and therefore sorting) on some messages, lack of swipes, a crash constantly occurring when receiving some type of messages (probably malformed but no other client I have tried crashed because of that), and missing features in notifications."
5.949999999999999,1,1,New version fails to send messages I have to keep trying until it finally sends by repeatedly resending from outbox sending function has a bug in it serious bug advised never to get new versions of this app because they add new bugs back

5.9,2,0,"Not Bad, but EATS data & Battery I wanted a mail client that would allow me to store all of my email on the external SD card as the internal memory on the Desire is very poor.  After reading around, this (K-9) was the client that received the best reviews AND would allow storage onto the SD card, so I downloaded it. I was very happy with it, but recently my battery life has been less than 24 hours compared to my usual 48+.  After checking with some apps, I found the culprit to be K-9.  Checked my data and in just 1 day, close to 300MB had been used (only have a 1GB limit). Downloaded ONAVO COUNT and saw K-9 eating huge amounts of data, so, now I've had to disable email download to save battery & data.  The problem seems to be the Gmail account, and there are loads of people with the same problem. Now I need to find another client. Shame as I actually liked K-9, but because of data & battery problems, only 2* (HTC Desire 2.2.2 rooted)."
5.9,2,0,"2013: Truly wanted app to work. It has more features than many other mail programs and a nice UI for viewing emails. What I don't like is the unreliability. Email won't push, error messages that you can't read fully, messages just sit in my outbox and NEVER get sent. I'll check the bug list to see what's there but it would be nice to know what all these random error codes mean and to read the whole problem somewhere - like a log. 2020: Tried again but must know server settings to add account."
5.9,1,2,"Uses full bandwidth when fetching mail. Been using this for years but the time is right to move on. Just too poor and old. And it's starting to be a pain. Also, what's the point in spam folder when you can't mark things as spam? Could be a little more simple when setting up (like auto poll not working until background sync is set to always) but once sorted it's a good mail client (other than the above issues). But it's never going to evolve. Bye, was good to begin with."
5.9,1,2,"Update has broken it It was working really well until the last update, now I can no longer send or receive mail and get connection errors. From the number of reviewers complaining I'm not the only one, if I were K9 I'd roll back the release before everyone moves on."
5.9,1,8,"My poll frequency is set to 15 minutes for every single mail account and all kind of notifications are enabled. Unfortunately, more and more often mails aren't shown for at least two hours, which is a no-go for a mail app..."
5.9,1,8,"Simple things like auto fill for email addresses don't work. Want to email someone you have already emailed? Better write their address down on a piece of paper, because K9 mail won't remember it. Pretty weak"
5.9,1,2,"Crashing after last update Was working well until yesterday's update. Now it's just closing without any messages, when opening email. Not on all but on most emails! Pls return previous version!!!"
5.9,1,8,"Great until last update Emails are bigger than the display area, can't zoom out, therefore lots of needless scrolling around."
5.9,1,8,"How does this app work? I have tried everything including putting a lock on

5.85,2,1,"Won't sync my mail consistently under ics. Have used k9 mail for a couple of years with my htc thunderbolt with no problems.  However on my new tablet with ics the syncing doesn't work consistently.  Went to check their github wiki for any possible info on this and strangely enough this version of k9 mail isn't shown.  The last version shown is the .9 version.  So I don't know what to make of this app now. UPDATE:  updated to latest new release and it still won't download next x messages.   Using nauseous now instead and it seems to be working much better than k9.   Too bad, I kind of liked this client but now it just doesn't seem to work very well."
5.85,1,3,"Still broken! Loved it, still hate it. It STILL loads old messages in and marks them as unread. This is such a simple thing to sort out... Do you want me to show you how to do it? Also, new interface is boring. Bring the colours back! Much better when it highlighted the email your chosen colour per account, rather than just a rubbish coloured dot. Loads of bugs, can't delete mail anyone because it crashes. HTC Desire, HTC One XL and Galaxy Ace"
5.85,1,3,"I've loved K-9 Mail for years, but I cannot tolerate the ""synching disabled"" problem any longer.  Having combed through forum after forum, and trying every proposed solution (which others are also saying no longer work), I can honestly day that the app has failed.  I really hate to say goodbye to this old friend, but it's clearly dead.  RIP, K-9 Mail."
5.85,2,7,"Have used it for years but now too buggy Over the last 3 or 4 months my Hotmail that I delete comes back randomly as new mail (I've deleted some mail 10 or 12 times over 4 months) and now all of the emails i had today have disappeared after I switched my phone off for a flight. Can't keep working like this, I'll have to move on..."
5.85,1,3,Not so good anymore this used to be a pretty good app however now it has issues could not get it to send email and created my account with wrong info. The only way to change it is by deleting the account. Actually I had to delete the app. This really needs  to be fixed. Samsung galaxy s4
5.85,1,3,App has become a joke Messages take forever to load since last update they used to load instantly. New update still same problem.
5.8,3,0,"MOTO X user 4/3/14 I just switched from a flip phone and iPod touch to the Moto. When I setup my exchange account, the app told me that my server REQUIRES me to allow it full access and control over MY phone. Bye bye. K-9 was setup in about a minute and a half, didn't need to allow access to any of MY personal information, and the interface looks to be well thought out and user friendly. I especially like the ""split screen in landscape view"". Granted, I haven't looked around that much, but this app works perfectly for me, so I'm done looking, on to better things. I don't even care that Gmail isn't supported. Great job, guys! Update 4/15/14: Gmail is supported but I ran into some problems when I decided to change settings on my Exchange account. Basically, every change I made caused some function to fail. Display, sync, notification problems got worse and worse until finally the app was beginning to make me feel stupid, so I uninstalled and moved on to a paid app. Regular IMAP/POP email is OK, but needs more work in order to use Exchange accounts."
5.8,3,6,"Used to be great. With Android 7 on my Galaxy S8 I don't get reliable pushes or polling (meaning no notifications of new emails). I have tried the Doze settings and all other recommended changes. It just isn't reliable anymore. I have to manually sync accounts or toggle wifi to force a reconnect which causes K-9 to resync. I have read several relevant bug reports on the tracker. There is no fix on the way as of now AFAICT. To anyone who thinks this is solved, it is not solved for all scenarios. It doesn't work for me but I'm happy for you if it works for you. It also doesn't blink the LED when it does manage to get new emails."
5.8,3,12,"My favourite but still leaves a lot to be desired. There are lots of issues, but the latest bug is in that when sending emails they often time out instantly and I get a ""failed to send"" notification in my notification bar and they remain in the outbox. Then when I open the outbox and select ""send emails"" from the drop down menu they get sent instantly."
5.8,2,8,"Everytime it seems fixed, it fails somewhere else. Current problem: Tried to send email, failed. Tried from 3 different accounts, all three failed. But the best part? No matter what I did, it just kept trying to send. Drained my battery, overheated my phone, and was still trying to send. Finally gave up and uninstalled after 15 hours."
5.8,1,4,Had to delete my favorite app Had to delete after last update as the app would no longer download emails manually or automatically. Need to let us move to SD card.
5.8,1,4,"Update dont work After update 5.005 I get SSL problem, please fix it. So I need to downgrade to the version 4.804"
5.75,3,1,"Better than most but much to be desired 1 - Maybe I'm missing it, but I don't see a feature that permits me to globally delete or archive all my emails older than a certain date, or just display recent emails.  Other systems can do so.  The reason I need this feature is that I run a small business and -- like many other people -- have kept old business emails on my server,  So, whenever I remove new emails from my phone and then sync to the server, these old emails populate the phone.  I need to be able to have a feature to globally remove those old emails from my phone without deleting them from the server, and without deleting my new emails.  The only way I can do so now is by globally putting a check box next to EVERY email currently displayed on my phone, then manually removing the check box from recent emails, and then deleting what remains checked.  This can be tedious since I get about 150 emails a day, and want to be able to keep the last 2 weeks' emails on my phone. 2- To add insult to injury, once I manually deleted emails from 2011-2012 from my phone, old emails from 2010 started appearing in my phone inbox as if they were sent to me today."
5.75,2,3,"Sending email now broken I had been able to send email using 3g and wifi. Now can't send email with 3g. Spotty sending using wifi. Tried turning phone on & off, Tried toggling air plane mode. Checked out going server settings - they are unchanged. Uninstalled other apps. The messages sit there in my outbox, after I try to resend them. A mobile email app that doesn't send email, only reads it. So Annoying. OptimusV, 2.2, virgin mobile 3g. Removed data, re-added accts. Nope. Uninst, reinstall: nope."
5.75,1,5,"4.4 update Just got the new update. Congratulations on completely missing the point of why you started this application in the first place. If you are looking for a gmail program that replaces the bloat of the official version with a whole slew of its own bloat, then K9 is your choice.   If you're looking for a fast, powerful alternative to the email client that came with your phone, then keep looking. K9 has apparently abandoned that idea."
5.75,1,5,Used to work well but each update has got more buggy Current version just gives synching disabled instead of fetching e-mail Time to uninstall
5.7,3,2,"I used to love this app but last couple of updates have made some really annoying changes. Have to scroll to bottom of rcvd email to see attachments, some emails will show in inbox but when try to open K9 closes down, sync doesn't seem to work properly now, will go hours without getting new messages and loads come in together, and pictures in mails don't always show properly. Please give me older version back, I used to love it!!!"
5.7,2,10,"Was a great app for years and I recommended it to many folks.  However, it has intermittently stopped syncing email on my last few devices.  Dug into dev forums to resolve, but nothing appears to work to correct the issue.  Moving on to an email app that, well, receives email."
5.7,1,6,Since updating  I can no longer reduce the size of my mailboxes. When I delete the trash it still shows the same size for each email account which continues to grow with each email.  The 2 most recent updates are a disaster.
5.7,1,6,"Bad update I have been using this app for years, never had a problem until last update.  I have been fighting this app for data usage.  And every week it keeps going higher and higher over past few months."
5.7,1,6,So slow it's worthless (v5.202) They turned a pretty good app into a pile of garbage with the 5.202 release. Now messages take 6+ second to display each time. Used to be super quick. Too bad.

"
5.699999999999999,1,0,"For years, this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways, demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now, unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client, it will appear below the list of unread messages, completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions, but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent.   There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way, and messages read in K-9 in another way, is just extremely poor development, and it needs to be fixed."
5.699999999999999,1,0,"Used to be my go to app This was once the only email app I would ever use. But it has really gone downhill since. There are so many bugs it isn't even funny! Deleting emails and they just come back. Displays duplicates, even though the server is correct. Marking emails as read and they just come back as unread a few minutes later. Not to mention, this app doesn't even support S/MIME certificates for signing and encrypting emails. Oh, but they give you the option to use another app for this, but that app doesn't even support one of the most popular certificate types (S/MIME). If these devs get their acts together and bring this app back up to par, then I would be happy to try it again and rerate for more stars. But as it stands today, this app is not even worth 1 star."
5.699999999999999,1,0,"loved it... now don't was using on my nexus 5.  it was a struggle and a half to get my icloud account working, but i was finally able to do so.  when i switched to the moto x, copied all of the settings exactly from the nexus, and yet the icloud account cannot be configured to send mail.  tried everything.  tired of fighting with it.  chose the stock android mail app and lo and behold, the account set up automatically and correctly when i input the account information.  sadly deleting K9 from my phone since it's useless to me if i cannot send mail from it."
5.699999999999999,1,0,"The Very Devil To Set Up Might be the best email client in the world for all I know, but its far too fiddly to set up. All the other clients I tried were easy - enter username and password; bish bosh job done for most accounts. By contrast getting ""cannot connect to server"" after using the exact same methods that work with other clients is frustrating in the extreme. I don't want to be forced to post on a forum and be told to try a number of convoluted steps, or to contact my various email providers simply to get the thing working"
5.699999999999999,1,0,"Used to be great - no more All K9's great features are outweighed by 3 major defects:  1. It's become so slow as to be virtually unworkable. Mass-deleting spam, for example, now takes 5 minutes when it used to take 30 seconds.  2. It's now hugely unstable. Frequent crashes are the norm, and filling in the reports is pointless as there's no-one to reply. 3. Because it's open source, there's no customer support to ask for help. And if I had the time to trawl forums for info, then I wouldn't have the problem in the first place!"
5.699999999999999,1,0,"Really bad desition Last update will kill K9 I loved this app for many years on different phones, because it's different. I don't like Gmail. Last update simply makes me evaluate other apps. So many changes it's not K9 anymore. Now you can't even change the displayed names of contacts, I don't want to send mgs with the name on contact list. But worse you can't see text on msg if it considers is a thread msg, even when threaded view is off. Please give us back the older version"
5.699999999999999,1,0,"does not work anymore I have this apllication for over 6 months and it was the best mail client around, but now, since the last update, it does not give me any notification about new emails. i have it at a 2h fetch poll and it does nothing, i have to hit the check mail button for it to work. please fix it. i use it on a Galaxy S with Android 2.2. P.S.: on my girlfriends phone it works with no problem what so ever, she has an LG Optimus One, running Android 2.2"
5.699999999999999,2,4,"Really doesn't like Hotmail. Better than the client that came with my Galaxy Tab (it displays HTML!) but having ongoing problems. Constantly having to mark emails as read AGAIN. Can't move items from trash back to inbox (why?!); other options to move items don't work; now suddenly showing only 4 emails instead of 50 despite the settings, which no longer seem to have any effect on anything. I'm  downgrading the star rating again; now only 2 stars."
5.699999999999999,1,0,"EDIT: Privacy/security leak will be fixed with next major update.  Privacy/security risk: K-9 honours meta-refresh and will open browser links directly upon opening a mail which uses them. That is VERY bad.  Other than that, it is very user un-friendly, ugly and doesn't work all too good.  Still, it is one of the few non-cloud based email clients, which is very sad."
5.699999999999999,1,0,"used to be my favorite apps, but since last update i've got lost all my starred email from my inbox and unable to find it in any folder. It just dissapear.

5.699999999999999,1,0,"Worked well, now garbage Since the last update, I've been getting certificate errors. It's not the host. Based on what I'm seeing here, other puerile are having the same problem. Unable to securely send or receive makes this app useless, sadly."

5.65,3,3,"Edit: Still using K9 Mail.  The most annoying thing about this app is deleting multiple emails.  Rather than press and hold to enter into a ""select mode"" where you then tap all your emails you want to delete, you have to press and hold each email and choose ""select"".  This takes ten times longer to simply delete multiple emails.   It's rather painful amd annoying.    All of a sudden I could no longer send email, only receive.  I went to the server settings for outgoing mail, and clicked next and immediately got an error.  I didn't notice at first, but after the update, www was added in front of my outgoing server.  removed the www and it worked fine as it should.  Thought I'd post this in the review section in case others come here with the same issue"
5.65,1,1,"New version is crap - artificial threading? Why? As the title suggests, the artificial threading that's been added with the new update is crap... and there's no obvious way to turn it off!  Why is is crap? Because it complicates navigation within a folder needlessly: when reading a message, the next/previous icons (""<"" "">"") only move within that thread, while the previous up and down icons took me to the next or previous new message in my inbox, without having to navigate back out of the thread first! Again, the threads are entirely artificial... which is also annoying!"
5.65,1,1,Another app bites the dust Another application that worked brilliantly and was incredibly versatile. but is now broken and so buggy that it's unusable. If you have access to an older version use that. Unlikely that the security compromises will hit you in the older version but certain that the new bugs will make you delete the app altogether. A real pity. Author: Do some basic testing yourself before release. Don't rely on your bug tracker. How did you manage to get such a brilliant app written in the first place with that attitude. Sticking to the older version.
5.65,2,5,"I have used K9 for quite a few years without problems - and it used to allow more than one server and worked flawlessly - until 3 weeks ago, when it stopped being able to send emails. That highlighted 2 serious issues: 1. It does not indicate whether emails are unsent, and 2. Outbox and Sent mailboxes are not included in the top left mailbox list, so unsent messages are not easily noticed."
5.65,2,5,"Lagging my note 2 Ever since last update my phone has been seriously lagging, have to restart and remove battery several times a day. Clean master helped me to identify that this is my problem app. I hate to remove it as it had been great until now. I just hope there is an update soon. I can't stand what it's doing to my phone. Please update soon it's killing my phone!"
5.65,1,1,Wipe Out Last 2 upgrades have wiped out all saved and deleted emails. Other than screen printing not much of a way to save one external to the program. Not good when you might need hotel and travel confirmations not to mention event tickets. You can exclude a program in Play updates without doing each individually so dumping the program
5.65,1,1,"Please fix sending error I used this app for 2 weeks.  All seemed to work well.   Over the weekend I was getting negative smtp reply error.  Same error for both of my email addresses...including my Gmail address.   Delete and re installed...same error.  I found many posting about this error, but no fix.  Had to delete app and moving on."
5.65,1,1,"Recent update slow and imap delete fails I have been using for some time and like it, but the recent update makes imap deletes fail and introduces bugs and slowness.  Would love to see those back to the way it was working to give five stars again."
5.65,1,7,I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately it is unusable. Insisted on downloading my entire POP3 account. Never made it to 2017. Now it will only download 6 messages at a time. It will never make it to 2017.

5.65,1,7,"I liked this app when it worked, does not sync anymore. Worthless at this point."
5.6,1,2,"Used to be the best but no longer The latest release of this program took it from a 5 rto a 1. I can't open messages without it going into automatic reply. When I finally get to just reading the message, the 'reply' and 'reply all' options are no longer there. The way in which mail accounts show up is also much more kludgy than in previous releases. I don't know what they thought they were fixing but I'm going to another mail client until this one stabilizes."
5.6,2,6,"Best interface with unacceptable bug 80% of the time, deleting email's results in crash notification: ""Unfortunately K-9 Mail has stopped."" just too irritating to accept. Submitting crash reports have resulted in no feedback from K-9 let alone a problem fix.  It's really a shame because it has my favorite look & features. Manage 2 important POP3 email accounts & need better reliability /stability."
5.6,2,0,"Old version much better Even though there are some useful additions, the old version was much better: - a LOT faster - more mails visible (small screen - even after settings tweeking) - more reliable checking for new mails - settings less chaotic - whole ui much more user friendly  - news I like:  - sleep hours - easier selection of multiple emails  Old version would get 4.5 stars..."
5.6,2,6,"Have used K9 for years and loved it.  Now, as many of you I have the sync disabled amd emails dont get pushed through unless manually do it.  I rated it a 2 in hopes that this will be fixed.  Would love to keep it over others but it has become a deal breaker.  Fixing the battery optimization has not worked.  I am on the S8+"
5.6,1,2,Done with K9-Gone to MailDroid I was unable to edit email I wanted to forward. Couldn't edit without removing the graphics and hot links. There is probably a simple answer but I could never get a reply to my question. Not even once would they ever answer my request. I'm done....gone to MailDroid. Works great!
5.6,1,2,"No longer works App used to be great but no longer works. When I try to open it, I repeatedly get an error message that says the app has stopped working. That message pops up repeatedly even after I kill the app. Had to uninstall. So sad, I've used this app for years and now must find another one."
5.6,1,2,"Latest update sucks My K9 client updated automatically when I purchased my new phone and installed my apps. It now takes 30s to load an individual email, without pics. It's not the phone it's the app. I am forced to search for a replacement to K9, what a shame."
5.6,1,2,"Does it work for anyone? Doesn't appear to work at all, and that's just going to Gmail :-( Load 26 more just displays some error message which is gone too fast to read and returns you to the same empty screen."
5.55,2,1,"Several flaws that  need addressing 1.  notification bar inbox totals reflect ALL the inbox messages not just the new ones.  2.  You cant put checks into the boxes easy to select individual emails on the inbox home screen. it wont place a check in the box, it opens the message instead, when it does work it usually selects 2 messages. 3.  you cant put checks in the boxes on the inbox home screen and select spam!  Come on, why do i need to open the message in order to select spam?? 4.  The messgae headers are bolded and easy to read, the 2 or 3 line preview is light grey?  Hard to read.  You need options to set the preview lines text."
5.55,1,3,"UNINSTALLING see UPDATE... Awesome 5 stars PLUS! I seldom give superb ratings, but this developer has now created an AWESONE, must-have app.  UPDATE : After update 4.409, SERIOUS LAG, FORCE CLOSES. NO HELP FROM DEV. UNINSTALLING CAN'T USE. UPDATE #2, TRIED INSTALLING AGAIN AND I'M UN-INSTALLING AGAIN. TOTALLY USELESS, LOCKS CONSTANTLY, CANNOT EVEN ACCESS MAIL NOW. I OFFERED DEBUGGER HELP TO DEV, BUT WAS TOLD THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. TOO BAD."
5.55,1,3,"Such a shame This *used* to be great, however since May 2015, I've been unable to get ANY new email across any of my many email accounts - and as such have had to get accustomed to Google's main offering.  I updated K-9 tonight,  but it refuses every account I have, saying either the username and/or password is at fault, when none of them are incorrect.  Result: Uninstalled."
5.55,1,3,"Update made it unusable - January 2017 Edit - Email doesn't download anymore, and it DESTROYS my battery now.

This free solution cured my problems and seems to work better overall. Love it."
5.55,2,7,"I've been using this app for my non-work Gmail account. The huge benefit of K-9 over the Gmail app is that it doesn't link messages. However, it is not reliable and fails to collect all gmail message, no matter how much prompting is given (missing messages can be seen in the Gmail page on the PC). Gmail app is cr@p, but at least it is reliable."
5.55,1,3,"The ""sync diasbled""-bug is still going strong with this one ... Edit: the ""syncing diasabled""-stuff was just the standard text showing at the top of the gui, I learned to life with it. But after the last update I can't access one of my accounts in the app anymore. Renders it useless"
5.55,1,3,"Used to love it It was awesome until yesterday's update. Now it's very slow, and no longer deletes messages from the server. If I can't go back to the older version I'll have to find another app."

5.5,3,0,"Room for improvement I was excited about the possibility of a full featured IMAP client, and it does technically work, but it's just missing too many common sense elements to really rate highly.  Some examples:  - bulk inbox edit is much more clunky than other clients (eg gmail).  - it's impossible to view deleted (not expunged) messages in a folder's message list.  - it has no option to undo accidental deletion. - it forces you to retrieve at least a few K of each message in addition to headers, possibly wasting bandwidth.  - if you tell it not to download each full message body immediately, it forces you to click a button to read each message, rather than downloading automatically when you open it, like all other clients do.  - does not have ""always show images from this sender"" setting"
5.5,3,0,"I thought it was doing okay,  but Keeps crashing. Reduced rating down from 4.5 to 2.5. :( I'm Not willing to send report  because the Report button doesn't allow me to see what's being collected and for me to choose or approve.    I greatly appreciate being able to export settings, & receipts, & many other features.    Other than the need to fix crash problem,  I can only suggest 3 things:    1. Allow messages  to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date;  like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones.   2. Allow to only download headers;  again like default email app.   3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone.  Especially when setup as an IMAP connection."
5.5,2,2,"Good app but can't update I used to really like K9 but now I don't since the latest update. The new blobs that indicate whether a message has been read or not just waste screen space. When there's a new message notification for one message, it takes you to that message, not the unread message list like it used to. The unread message list says 'inbox' at the top. It isn't my inbox. The unread message list auto updates after any action so you can't do 'mark as read' and then delete (or mark as unread if you make a mistake. Annoying!"

The size of the font varies from email to email. Seems like it used to always be the same size. If I pick a size of normal the text on some emails is too small. But if I pick larger it's too large on other emails. I can pinch to zoom in but then I have to scroll left and right to read the email. None of these problems with the last version I had.
5.5,3,6,"Another vote against the horrible new icon. Also the app doesn't display properly if you have larger font size set on the phone, the font size options in the app can correct some but not all of this. The annoying problem with Gmail being blocked on WiFi networks is still there too. Overall the Dec 2017 update seems to have made a few things worse and not fixed or improved anything. I hope this isn't a sign of the future direction."
5.5,2,2,"Tried again, still no Several things I don't like, but two main ones. One, the notifications of new mail bring me right to the newest message, not the inbox, which causes me to open mail I may wish not to open. Two, the box  to select is way small and hard to press, so instead it just opens the message. I have to battle that a while. Not good, sorry. :("
5.5,3,6,"Current version (5.402) and last few versions have had a crashing problem with my phone (Moto G5) so I've had to stop using it. (Your mileage may vary.) Have reported bug on Github so hopefully the devs can find a solution. Oh, and the new icon isn't great, but that's just a small niggle by comparison."
5.5,1,4,THIS APP SEEMS TO BE FALLING APART - WHEN IS A FIX BEING RELEASED ? BUG - App has a lot of crashes when deleting email. BUG - App displays multiple email items on top of each other after tagging multiple emails. BUG - SERVER DELETIONS FAILS !!!!!!!!!
5.45,1,5,"Too much options not universal. Don't need the extensive list of options per email with poor defaults. Got 12 emails, don't need hundreds of options needing changed. Let me set one default preset that all emails will adopt by default, just set a button to set email to default preset, then people can change few things they want to change, but make most their setting set to defaults they want easily"
5.45,1,5,"Used to be better than google spyware Used to be great, but... Since the devs stopped listening to users it has become useless if you use ssl self signed certs on SUPPORTED operating systems. Devs say it is insecure. Thats MY problem, not theirs. Now have to find something that WORKS instead of this now useless piece of junk."
5.45,1,5,"My favorite email client for years, but it's awkward and full of annoying little bugs. And, no, I don't want to spend hours navigating your user UN-friendly site just to try to report this. I tried that. It's a huge waste of time. Samsung galaxy s6"
5.45,2,9,"Worked great for quite a while, but now doesn't work at all. Can't figure out what I need to change to try to make it work right, and simply don't have hours and hours of time to waste. Very sad :("
5.45,2,9,Syncing Disabled bug is back with nougat and makes the app unusable to monitor email. Don't rely on k9 mail if you are expecting something important.
5.449999999999999,2,3,"Set up still a mess! 2017 UPDATE (original review 2013) - For approx' 5 years I've used K9 as my main email client. The setup is still a problem, complete hit or miss. Hours are spent on forums trying to find the correct settings for accounts to work correctly. The auto settings used by the app simply do not access accounts (Yahoo!) correctly. The best app ONCE SETUP, but setup really makes this awful."
5.449999999999999,2,3,"I really like this app and have used it for years, however the recent update stopped clearing notifications when emails are deleted.  Small, but annoying.  Also, images now take forever to load regardless of connection speed or type."
5.4,1,0,"Can't get it to work I've been trying to get this to work for a client as well as for myself. I'm trying it on two different email servers with two different accounts. Neither work. These are both Exchange 2010 servers. The error message doesn't lead me in any useful direction. It just doesn't work. If I go ahead and add the account then its impossible to figure out how to adjust the settings afterwards. I just have to delete the account and start over. Again, it never worked on either account. The only plus side is it was free."
5.4,2,4,"Barry Not ready for prime time. No PUSH for Yahoo email. Chokes on big folders. No way to attach serious file like PDF or DOC. Only silly things like pictures. (Now found that it will work with a 3rd party file mgr for other attachments.) Has much potential in the way it is configurable, but does not work well, is extremely slow and gets stuck on polling and loading. Also, when trying to slide an attachment for better viewing, will go to next msg. Extremely annoying. Doesnt access existing group lists of contacts"
5.4,1,0,Used to be great but not good lately I have used this app for my email for years and it was really good until a few months ago.  Since then the performance has been terrible and it crashed multiple times per day.  Even doing something as simple as opening an email.  This week it has stopped showing new emails.  I get notifications that I have new email but when I open the app the newest message in my inbox is from 5 days ago.  Please fix these issues or I will have to continue using another app.
5.4,1,0,"Terrible update This newest version sacrifices speed and features for...a better look, maybe? I don't know. It's much slower at displaying email, and the number of options available on one touch has been reduced. Sure, I can still move email around, but it's multi-click- why do I want that on a phone? Beats me. Someone on the dev team though ""good looks"" should beat out ""works great"". I'll be shopping for another email program. This is the first time I've 1-starred an app I previously loved."
5.4,1,0,"Seems latest update ruined it I've used this app for months to replace the crappy stock mail app on my Galaxy S5 without an issue. After speaking with clients later in the day today, I realized none of the emails sent this morning were sent. They were all hanging out in my outbox folder! After multiple attempts at resolving the problem, I gave up and defaulted to using my Gmail to send my messages. Thanks for the update that made me blow my productive work day!"
5.4,1,0,"Latest Update Trashed My Email The latest update completely deleted all local email, including mail I've sent from my phone that exists nowhere else, AND emptied two of the corresponding POP3 inboxes on the server, so all that mail is lost.  This is too severe of a fail for me to continue using this app.  Even if they do find and correct the problem, I can never trust updating in the future as I'll always be afraid of another epic fail like this.  Such a shame."
5.4,1,0,"AUTH PLAIN failed. Bugs, failiure to get message properly and... Constant AUTH PLAIN failed when sending.  K9 also has a bug where it can partially download a message, just partial headers and then can never get the whole message, the email then appears to be corrupted and listed as 'no subject', and nothing will bring it back. Also, related... k9 can't retrieve attachments over phone data these days. Only WiFi.  Needs fix. Gone crap."
5.4,1,0,"What happened? Worked great on my Kyocera Hydro Vibe with outdated Android. Now with my Moto G3 the app shuts down over and over, reading emails, loading, sending, but mostly switching between email accounts. Really sucka because I've been using K9 for quite some time and it is the best email app there is. Well it WAS until I updated phones. Sad that K9 mail isn't able to handle the upgrade."
5.4,1,0,Can't connect to Gmail / Security problem This app doesn't have the high security protocols to connect to Gmail. You have to set your Google Gmail account to a less secure setting to let this app connect. If you do that anyone and anything can try and access your account without you knowing it. So don't use this app.
5.4,1,0,"Setup not as smart as others I've installed 4 email programs to see which I liked best.  The other 3 required very little info to connect to my Exchange server.  But with this program, I've been unable to connect though I've tried many combinations of settings."
5.4,1,0,Too slow Haven't been to load a single message since the initial install. Shame. This is serious application design flaw. Note: 4 other email client perform this same task in seconds. This app tried for more 5 minutes on several attempts over a 2 week period.
5.4,1,6,"K9 used to be a good app, but now is unreliable (the infamous ""synching disabled"" issue...). Maybe it is a problem from Android and not from K9 but, anyway, as far as I know, there is no solution for this issue so I switched to another app... :-("
5.4,3,14,Starting to get annoyed ... I keep going and changing my settings to delete stuff of the server (pop3) when I delete it here ..... and then the next day (or two) my settings have changed BACK to NOT delete stuff off the server !!!
5.4,1,0,"Needs a ton of work No send, reply, etc. buttons when viewing messages.  Must use three dot menu. Messages show up as read even after viewing then or making them all read.  I have a galaxy nexus."
5.4,2,10,New version is hideous I hate all these ugly colors in the inbox. It looks like the Gmail app. Please go back to previous version. This one sucks. Looking for a new email app asap.
5.4,1,0,"Hate the update I've been using this app for many years & since this last update, nothing but issues. I also just got a new phone & can't even set it without an error!"
5.35,1,7,Why does the app need camera permissions? What is the connection between camera and VPN?
5.35,1,1,"Has never worked on my rooted S3 4.1.1 I could never get this app to push my Yahoo emails. I've tried rebooting and reinstalling. I've tried pushing all folders and only 10 folders. I've tried setting folder classes to 1st class and pushing only those. I've tried every idle time between 24 minutes and 1 minute. I first got this app 6 months ago and it never worked. I held on to it, hoping for a magical update. Today is 12/8/13 and I'm uninstalling it. According to Google, many users are suffering from this same problem."
5.35,1,1,"I have used this app for several years because Verizon quit email and Internet services, and wanted to keep my email address. This week K-9 stopped working again, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. It now doesn't recognize POP3 server. K-9 has quit working still again and won't accept either the incoming OR outgoing email settings. Please help if you can. Otherwise, I wish there was another similar app that I could switch to. For now, I have no email app and am not getting email. Thank you."
5.35,1,1,"Once an excellent mail app for IMAP connectivity.  Highly configurable, yet simplistic - until Android 7.  Even with Doze / Power Saving exempted or disabled, K-9 no longer reliably refreshes email.  They've had months to resolve this but apparently don't see it as a widespread issue.  There was a bug opener against it but it was ""locked"" with the notion that it's Android's fault.  Considering many other email clients have and continue to function, this is simply untrue."
5.35,2,5,"Doesn't support PGP/MIME Would be great for receiving GnuPG-encrypted mail, but it supports only inline PGP messages, which are widely discouraged and which most email programs don't do by default.  It's too much of a hassle to ask everyone sending you email to change the settings on their end to use inline instead of MIME just so you can read your email on your Android device."
5.35,1,1,"Nice when it works, but too often doesn't Too bad - although not perfect feature wise, nice progress in the right direction f(seems to lack grouping options).  BUT too often doesn't work.  Out of 4 days since installing, K9M has been not working 2 of the 4. (During this time the std Google mail app did work - fortunately).  Promising - once the bug(s) are ironed out."
5.35,1,1,"I just installed the latest version of K9Mail and am not impressed. I tried to create an account and it failed, for to an authentication error. The account I tried to configure was a Gmail and apparently Google was complaining because K9Mail still isn't using proper authentication methods. This bug has been around several years now and still not fixed!"
5.35,1,1,"Crashes frequently, very slow I used to love this app but frankly now, it sucks. It constantly freezes, it's slow to get things done, even simple things like marking all as read takes ages to perform and sometimes freezes the whole app. This app has become cumbersome and an annoyance and it's with regret that I have to look for something else."
5.35,1,1,"was great if weird, now unspeakably awful Latest version has minute long load times, crashes as it appears unable to multitask, loses outgoing email etc. Worthless.  Do not install  Older versions worked ok though the menu design was a little bizarre. The update and re architecture has totally ruined the product   LG intuition"
5.35,1,1,"Is thIs App going to get fixed anytime soon?? K9 App has worked great for years and suddenly all I get is a ""unfortunately k9 mail has stopped working"" error message that repeats every few seconds on galaxy s5 that I have to force stop.  From reading comments there is obviously a major problem that needs immediate attention"
5.35,1,1,"Used to be great - Stay AWAY! Great for years.  Now can't read email, all folders have Command: *sensitive* error message.  Lots of problems lately w gmail, so betting it is a K-9 / Google problem. Need to stay away from app until fixed. Not being able to read email on the go from any gmail accounts is a real problem."
5.35,1,1,Why is everyone so happy? I don't get why everyone likes it. My emails aren't syncing. I have to go in and refresh if I want to get emails. Plus I dont know when emails come in because it doesn't show up in the status bar. I don't see that in the settings either. I wouldn't use this app. Uninstall
5.35,2,5,"Been using this app for years and have loved it until this latest update. It's takes forever to check/download emails, locks up when searching and it drains my battery like crazy. Never had an issue before this update. Running in Galaxy Note 5"
5.35,1,7,It was wonderful until Android 6. Now sync not longer functions and the developer has not put the effort in to fix it (though other mail apps have). No longer recommended.
5.3,1,2,You ruined this app I've been using K-9 for years and loved it.  Unfortunately the latest releases (5.1 and up) are so full of bugs and annoying/unnecessary UI changes that it's become unusable.  I don't know what new programmers or philosophy you now have but you've managed to take what was probably the best Android email client and destroyed it. Luckily I was able to downgrade to an older version and will use it for the time being until I have to find something else.  For those out there who haven't upgraded yet DON'T!
5.3,1,2,"I am trying K-9 Mail for the first time as the developer of Open Keychain s h ows it as a suggested app. I must say I am disgusted that even though I have my key associated with the K-9 app, I am unable to send a signed and encrypted email to my ProtonMail account. My ProtonMail is 4096-bit encrypted and my OpenKeychain PGP key (associated to K-9) is also 4096-bit. So why the popup saying it cannot be encrypted due to one or more recipients...? Fix this or I will be right back to K@Mail!"
5.3,1,2,"Won't display emails on Nexus 5 At first, I couldn't read any emails that were plain text. Then I got an update after having used my Nexus 5 for like 2 hours and it worked. Now it's not working again and it's even worse. Now it won't display any emails."
5.3,2,6,"Used to be great Often doesn't send mail, gives me a fail to send error, I've switch to using my browser which is what I used to on my laptop before it died. I'm out of work and need something reliable."
5.3,1,2,"Used to be good... Any time I try and add a new gmail account, it crashes right after checking incoming server settings. Tried reinstalling and now I can't even set up ONE account!"
5.3,1,2,Used to be good. But for last few months keeps going to a sync disabled mode and don't get emails unless I manually sync. This happens on multiple devices i use.
5.3,1,2,Since last update its all gone wrong... Email doesn't show up altho notification shows I have 22 new emails...please sort this out
5.3,1,2,"Not working well after update Had been great, now slow. Fails to connect and send mail... then will later send."
5.3,1,2,Bad update. Notification always wrong. Always says 4 new messages even when there is only 1.
5.3,1,8,I still absolutely HATE the new icon!!! It's a black mark on an otherwise great app.
5.25,3,11,Works with wi-fi but tends to fail to connect via 4G. Needs an in-depth and easy to understand set of instructions and set-up guide for people unfamiliar with ShadowSocks.
5.25,1,3,"Timed Out - every time Every time I tried to download a short Mp4 it failed. Had to use another VPN with a similar good rating, which works."
5.25,2,1,"Looks Promising, No Good Yet Though As with many programs about today, for all systems not just mobile devices, the idea looks good and some of the basics look great. Beyond that important features seem to not get looked at and the community tends to stop fixing and keep adding more broken features.   There are several issues which make this unusable, it won't open attachments, it corrupts attachments when forwarding mail, Bcc doesn't work properly and that is as far as I've got so far, I only sent 10 mails, 9 of which were test mails.  I like the features, even though they don't work. The reason I installed K9 was because HTC mail doesn't do what I want it to so I have a choice, use HTC mail and not have any of the features I want or use K9 and have the features but accept the fact that none of them work and it could all come crashing down at any moment. I use my email a lot for work, I would happily pay for a working version of K9, same as I would happily pay for a working version of many free but not quite working programs\apps.  I'll keep an eye on this, but like many other programs and apps I have used\installed in the past, I doubt anything will happen in the next 10 Years."
5.25,2,1,"Clean and quick. But bug-ridden. To test K-9 I added only my Exchange (WebDav) account. Connection was flawless, and data was read fast. I went to the Unified Inbox and there was my Exchange email. I started to explore, and went into the inbox for the Exchange account. At this point, the messages were downloaded again. Returning to the Unified Inbox, all of the messages were duplicated--two of each. I checked the folder list under the Exchange account and there are two inboxes listed. Why? I uninstalled and reinstalled... messages get duplicated in the same folder. It's ridiculous. Then I added another account, used the ""move up"" option to rearrange the accounts in the list, and it *duplicated* the account!"
5.25,3,5,"UPDATE: It's been my favorite mail client for years, it usually just works once you've set up everything. Perfect for IMAP. Though, with Android 6 you have to manually exclude K-9 from battery optimization, else it will stop receiving new mails. However: Ever since a recent major update, they changed parts of the GUI. In message view, attachments are now displayed at the very bottom. You have to scroll aaaaaaall the way down to even notice attachments. So easy to overlook, and to accidentally delete a billing mail because the first few lines looked like every other spam email. What were they thinking?? Give us an option to switch this back!"
5.25,2,1,"Good app, but always leaves connections open making it unusable While I liked K-9 for all the features that it has and it's new interface, ultimately my IT department made me and a coworker stop using it because my account always had a ton of IMAP connections left open and it would connect with new ones.    Similar things happen with other emails like gmail.  If I open up logcat, there's always a ton of K-9 messages there about too many simultaneous connections and other random exceptions and null errors.  There are several open bug reports about these issues, so maybe in time this will get fixed."
5.25,2,1,"No search facility. With thousands of Gmails in the list, it's kinda' nice to have a basic string search function - as with most other Email clients I've used to-date.  Links in Emails don't work on my S2 running Ice Cream Sandwich.  Also a bit buggy on occasion, and WiFi disable usually hangs if K9 is open at the same time - needing a phone reboot to recover.  Sadly, despite the better K9 user interface, the default client remains an improvement so I'll  just stick with that."
5.25,1,3,"Bummer! It looks great in the pics, but apparently you need an email to set this up, How stupid! Why do you think I'm looking at email apps?! I need email, duh! 🤦‍♂️ Then it errors about ""Certificates."" Let me know when this works though, it looks like it'd be 5star stuff otherwise"
5.25,2,7,Will not let me set up gmail accounts. Not even using manual setup. Tells me my username or password is wrong; it's not. No problem with setting up yahoo accounts though.  Turned on Allow Access settings in Gmail. but k9 still can't get past the first stage of set up for it
5.25,3,11,"Battery drain I like k9, but it's a major battery drainer on the latest Android. Also according to the reports on the intarwebs I am not alone with that problem. Apparently it does let your phone go to deep sleep (wake lock and/or mobile active)"
5.25,1,3,"Unpredictable Used to really like this app. But it's unreliable. It's failed to send/receive mail twice in the last 4 days. Only uninstall & reinstall fixed it. Now, I have to do it AGAIN."
5.25,1,3,"Keeps stopping Used to be great, but now crashes (stops) several times each day on my new phone. Getting ready to uninstall if not resolved soon."
5.25,1,3,New version does not work Fetches headers but when I open email its empty. Notifications does not route to the app. Not usable in this version.
5.25,1,3,Outgoing mail Fails Frequently outgoing mail's fail ..error 500 or something like that..hours trying no use..It stressed me lot..
5.2,1,4,Can't even log in with my Gmail Email. Continuously tells me that it cannot connect and to change the settings on a computer. Well idk what settings I didn't change 5 times but still not working!
5.2,1,4,"I've used this for years and it was great, but for months now it's had problems with syncing being disabled. I can't wait any longer for someone to decide to fix this."
5.2,3,12,"Flawless until last update...would be 5 stars but: Spam folder disappeared, app stopped receiving new email, and it gives an IO error for the inbox.  Not amused..."
5.2,1,4,Still ... Not working with Exchange Tried to add Exchange account. Error cannot connect to server. IOException.
5.2,1,4,Ever since newest android update sync is disabled most of the time. Randomly will work from time to time.
5.15,1,5,It works beautifully. edit: it's not connecting anymore. what happened? edit: still not working. what a shame
5.15,1,5,It doesn't work.I can't connect to server after once using
5.15,2,3,"Was great but the new update has bugs Love this app and the last update, but now has a new unexpected glitch. When composing a new email then highlighting text to be edited, the Select all, Copy, Paste, WebSearch buttons at the top of screen cannot be seen because they're covered with black.  The buttons are still there, but you have to guess where the button positions are. If you touch the correct button position all works fine, but this needs to be fixed."
5.15,2,3,"I Receive An Error Each Time I Send An Email. I like the app, but I receive an error message saying ""Failed to send some messages"" EVERY time I send an email. I then have to go to the Outbox & press the refresh button a couple of times in order for the email to successfully send. This happens every time I send an email. Every time! Btw, you're getting a lot of negative reviews from users. What gives?"
5.15,2,3,New app design launched July 2013 is awful I have been a K9 email user for over a year and have loved it up until today. The new redesign updated July 2013 is visually awful and generic looking. I also don't like how they are now a limited number of messages that are viewable on my phone screen because of its new layout and spacing format. I'm going to find another email app and uninstall.
5.15,2,3,"Time to move on... Used this for years and loved it.  When I upgraded my phone and put K9 on it, it loaded a newer version... which will not send emails. Checked online & other users have the same issue. I will try K9 again in a few months to see if the issue has been resolved.... I liked it that much."
5.15,2,9,Sync with mail server has become dysfunctional since latest app update. It will start sync and stay stuck in sync mode until I force stop the app and restart it. This has rendered the app useless. Worked great for past 3 years now it's a wreck!
5.15,1,5,doesn't sync on Wi-Fi since android 7. and no way to undelete something from trash. When I use voice to text in the program it duplicates what I'm saying and I have to end up deleting
5.15,3,13,deleted mails is showing double copies at Trash any kind souls using K9 experiencing same with solution? please help
5.15,1,5,Sync problem Of late has been unreliable in fetching mail. Looses sync.
5.1,2,4,"TLDR: Functional, but broken. This is no longer my primary email app, as the sole dev (his choice to refuse any fixes!) has obviously abandoned it. The number of issues that are simply being ignored is getting silly - this is NOT an open source project, just a ""source available"" one. I used to advise anyone that asked to install K9, but can't do that any more. Dropped mails, useless notifications, broken config, stuck outgoing messages, poor code quality (shown by power usage). Now a PoS!"
5.1,1,0,"New version pretty, but dumps features What happened to the spam button?    I also notice that when I do the whole set as spam through multiple menu clicks, it drops back to the previous message, even though I have it set to go to the next message.    Plus I can no longer tell whether I have an email or text message from the icon in the status bar.    On the whole I don't see a point to this release except a useless facelift and feature downgrade."
5.1,3,2,"Doesn't look right on tablet. DISCLAIMER: Google+ should not be needed to review free apps!   I would like to use K9, but I find the lines and fonts for message headers too closely spaced for comfort. Also, during a failed send, there is no way to force the email to resend. This is frustrating and should be a feature.   This makes twice I have tried K9 over the last two years and ended up uninstalling both times. (Once on phone, once on tablet.)"
5.1,1,0,"App is compromised? So I installed the app. And added about 7 or 8 Gmail accounts to it. All for various things. 3 of them had ""suspicious account log in attempts"" that Google prevented. I have not had c any issues w my mail security until now.  And one of the acounts is brand new. Ive emailed one person w ot. They are a friend. I trust them.i cant prove that its the app, but if it feels like, smells like, tastes like...."
5.1,1,0,Really sucks I've been using this for 6 months now. Right away I could never open links in emails. Maybe it was just a setting issue but I could never find a way to change it. I emailed the designers with no response. Now lately it's been notifying me of emails that aren't there. Talk about annoying!!! Every 10 minutes!!  I finally disabled my notifications. I'll be deleting this one soon and finding another email app.
5.1,3,2,"Needs update for modern phones/OS I've used this app since android 1.5 and found it vastly superior to the stock client. Unfortunately, new phones like the Nexus 4 lack a dedicated search button. This means there is no way to access the built in search function in k9 any longer, which really makes this app a lot less useful. I've installed the k9 based (but not free) kaiten mail in order to address this issue."
5.1,1,0,Decent client if you like getting constantly hacked. Have had this on my phone for a few months. The interface is kinda confusing and it can be complicated when you need to change the settings. In the past few months I have been hacked 5 times!! I'm constantly having to change my password. I've never had this much trouble on any other client. Therefore I'm deleting this sooo today.
5.1,1,0,"Illogical For someone who is used to emails on PC this app works in a very strange way, for one thing for some unknown reason it keeps loosing emails from the inbox when checking for new ones I've set it to save all emails but that does,nt work, I'm using a tablet not a phone and have plenty of room, why can't these email apps work the same as normal PC programmes"
5.1,1,0,"Good for reading, bad for writing. Doesn't save drafts body text (just the header). When using the Hacker Keyboard, it'll sometimes exit and send an incomplete email if ctrl is accidentally hit. Used this since the first Android G-1 came out, now it looks like I may need to let it go as it may have cost me potential job offers and clients."
5.1,1,0,"Can't Connect!!! In 20 seconds downloaded and  got Mail Droid to connect and work flawlessly using auto detect settings.  Thought I'd try K-9 because it looks cool but won't connect to Yahoo. Come on guys, simple wins the day. If folks can't easily connect they'll move on to something else. Most of us DO use a free email provider."
5.1,1,6,After using the app for sometime I have had to delete it. The app is not reliable at all. I constantly have draft emails that just delete and cannot be used once they are in the trash. The app seems to generate lots of duplicate emails as well. The other issue is that it is really just unreliable as a critical app.
5.1,1,0,"Even in 2016 I still hate K9 This is one of the worst most complicated user-unfriendly apps I've ever tried. I don't care how secure and powerful it is. It's a pain and I immediately uninstall it every time I try it. Play along with Google Apps, Gmail, and others and make it easier for people to set these up."
5.1,1,0,Terrible update-- I updated and tried to use. Terrible and slow. Hung up phone and tablet.  Had to uninstall and use backup of old to be able to keep using what once was a great email.  If does not change soon then maybe change or just keep using old version as is so good.
