org.thoughtcrime.securesms,196.1930894308943,1,656,"WHAT is the point of advertising ""private"" or ""secure communication"" if you are going to get into my contacts database and send me notifications that new users in my contacts have joined Signal?  I didn't ask for that information, the new users did not give their permission to share that information with me, and most importantly, I NEVER gave Signal permission to access my contacts.  Clearly Signal is NOT about protecting privacy.  Uninstalling."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,132.3211382113821,3,197,"Even though I still use this as my main texting app, unfortunately I have to knock off 2 stars for a huge flaw that the developers refuse to see as an issue. If a user has Signal installed and then uninstalls it, but doesn't unregister their Signal account, your texts will be sent via Signal and your intended recipient won't receive them via their SMS app. There's not a way for you to really know they uninstalled unless they tell you and it needs to be made more apparent to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister their account. Luckily, if you know your texts are going to a black hole, you can hold the ""Send"" button and force it to go via unencrypted SMS. I had 2 people who thought I was ghosting them because of this engineering oversight. You can still receive their texts, but they can't receive yours, so it makes you think communication is all good. Other than this massive flaw it's a fantastic app. Love the UI and feature set, but if there's even the slightest chance that I can send texts to someone and have them not receive it, that needs to be addressed ASAP before I can recommend this to anyone else. I've seen many threads open on this same topic and it falls on deaf ears. Pleeease devs, realize it's a problem and take steps to fix it! Some potential solutions: 1. Make it clear to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister 2. If someone's messages come in unencrypted, obviously they uninstalled Signal. The app should prompt a warning that the user likely uninstalled and that they won't receive your texts if you try to send via Signal, and recommend switching to unencrypted SMS. That's just off the top of my head and I'm sure there's more elegant ways to solve it."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,126.3821138211382,1,0,"This app is used all the time and is nearly perfect. Really bad with media though.  Only one image at a time. Can't send video sizes that standard pixel app can but pixel is special like that though even note 5 couldn't send much of a video file. Can't send messages to people without having to show your phone number which would make it more stealth. Also if you set messages to dissapear after certain time frame if android to iPhone , the time will go back to not dissapearing when the other person replies if they haven't also set it the same or set it at all. Also shame that it doesn't let you choose a app icon and shows its a messenger app unless you use a entire icon pack or launcher like nova.  Pixel is best phone ever and is only phone I haven't rooted and I'd like the app icon to appear as a calculator icon but I then have to change my launcher which sucks.  For a stealth app we should have icon options for home screen.   HOWEVER apparently the SMS and calls are secure and not logged with telco and not able to be retrieved from phone once deleted and can't be listened into so thats awesome if it's legit.  I know for a fact that if you out spyware on a mobile and clone a phone without person knowing then you can NOT view signal app SMS like you can every other app but you can listen to phone calls if you have control over the other handset microphone which can't be helped.   It's a legit app.very good at the basic needs so long as what we are told about it not being logged or recorded is true.  I'd pay plenty for this app if I had to and was able to attach a file or multiple images.  Would be great if you could have an option to send a message in a image too. So anybody who finds your phone and opens app sees a picture but not the message unless they had a code to extract the message from the picture like another appointment I've seen.  That would be a great feature . Thanks for this app"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,121.1239837398374,1,1,"STOP! Using Signal as your SMS app traps you forever! I found this out when I switched devices: Any friends who've sent a Signal message can't send an SMS to that person anymore. Anyone who has to stop using Signal for any reason becomes unreachable & the devs labeled the problem ""won't fix"". Once someone texts you by Signal, Signal won't let them send an SMS anymore; there is no option, no fix. Signal messages sent to a former user go to a black hole. No failure message, no notice that it wasn't received; SMS messages come in & your responses go nowhere. In short, trying Signal with even a few friends FUÂ¢<S YOU out of them ever being able to reach you by SMS ever again (unless they ALL quit using the app?). It's evil. DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR SMS! Ironically upbeat original review follows: Better than most messaging apps, has a nice Dark theme, & can also be your default SMS app, which is convenient (it's a trap! See warning at top). I don't like it telling everyone in my phone book that I'm on Signal. That's pretty invasive & should be optional. Encrypted Signal conversations seem to be stored only on each device, which is more secure, but means that if you reinstall or lose/break your phone, you lose all previous messages, irretrievably. Worse, there's no method to save just one conversation, just a raw .xml log of every message ever, with no encryption. A more secure way to back up individual conversations would put this app in 5-star territory. A Search to pick out certain words in my message history would be super handy too. So would Google Voice integration, or Google Hangouts, Google Allo, or Google Duo... Or get really wild & support WhatsApp messaging so we don't need both apps! Signal is not a decentralized messaging network, so it'll only work as long as Signal's servers are online, & encrypting the transmissions won't help if your phone (or your associate's phone) is hacked; Actual ""privacy"" may vary based upon your skills & how exposed you are in other ways. Don't blame the app if your device is insecure! Overall it's a very pleasant app to use. Making it my default SMS app means I never have to look at a phone's ugly default Messaging app (also means I'm trapped forever! See warning at top). If there's a better encrypted messaging app, I can't tell you about it. DO NOT USE FOR SMS, SEE WARNING AT TOP."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,114.0650406504065,2,1,"In the latest version (downgrade of the app, forced upon users) the text we view while writing is now even smaller & after we send a text, the words are larger. Can anyone say, ""Backwards!"" Who's idea was it to make the text larger AFTER we send it, WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER?! LOL. Does anyone read these reviews? Attempted to change 3 stars to 2 stars, because of latest downgrade. What makes ""smaller text"" part of a purported 'improvement', when the text was already too small?! Previous version (that didn't need fixing/breaking) displayed 2 checks to signify a text was received. Now, it's a circle with a check inside covering another circle, with a fragment of that circle visible. Why?? The 2 checks before was just fine & easier to see! * signifies improvements we're suggesting. * 2 checks please. Someone thought it a good idea to remove the color aqua/turquoise from color choices. Why?! Bring back what worked fine & stop wreaking the app. This is just what most app Undevelopers do to apps. They make changes, to show they're doing something, as if any changes made will be viewed as improvements. They are NOT improvements, hence the truth-telling above ""downgrade of the app"". We don't actually SEE any improvement in this version. Group chat, OK. We don't care about that. We'd like to SEE what we're writing. * And how about (as in native text app) as we wrote a text, let the window expand vertically, to more than 4 lines, so we don't have to scroll up & down just to see the first part of the sentence we're proof reading. We would have continued using older versions had we been given a choice. We save old APK files (installation files) of apps so we are NOT at the effect of these busybodies, the Undevelopers who ruin so many well functioning apps. It's as though the Undevs make changes, so as to look as though they're doing something & they are needed. In reading hundreds of reviews, we've discovered that many, many people are aware of this & at the effect of it, since they are NOT aware of how to save old APKs. Please stop wreaking Signal & manager, if there is one, please stop allowing these unnecessary downgrades of Signal to continue. * Please at least gives us the option to have larger text! * Again, let the window expand as we write... Although we appreciate the app & the idea, too often, a call doesn't connect & we have to restart app or even the phone. It's been like this for a looong time! On Android & iPoo. Have shared with many & many have same issue. Haven't noticed any improvement with this in 2 years. Video quality on calls not impressive. Sound quality sometimes OK. Good for sending files (sometimes). Wonder about any real privacy, since there's a mic in the phone? How does actual ""privacy"" happen in this situation? Signal is definitely worth having. Worth hoping for better... Nice to know (or ""believe"") Devs care about the consuming population. The way we actually speak of it is 4 stars. These words represent several individuals who use Signal. Thanks for doing your best!"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,110.52642276422765,1,223,"If it's so privacy focussed, why can't it be installed without granting permissions to almost everything on the phone? Why can't I use this messaging app without granting access to my calendar, or body sensors, or my contacts? Some specific permissions are needed obviously (e.g. camera & storage if you want to take a photo and send it). But why my calendar or contacts? Must be data mining or would allow installation without these permissions. BBM don't do it. So, Signal app cannot be trusted."

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,102.34349593495935,3,152,"Good most of the time. Since there is an option to use this as the default SMS app, there needs to be a way to blacklist people so that they always default to regular SMS instead of Signal. Several times I have replied to an SMS and it defaulted to Signal (it defaults for each message) even though the user no longer had Signal installed or had their notifications turned off. Also, when creating a group message, there needs to be a way to change it to sms/mms. If all of the people in the message have signal accounts, there's no way to change it to sms/mms. Same issue here. One of the people in the group no longer uses Signal. I had to ask someone to delete their Signal account because they no longer had the app installed. Shouldn't have to do that."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,101.84552845528455,1,1,"Do not install this app unless you're ok with it auto-generating unprompted marketing message spam to everyone in your contact list who happens to already be on signal, with a completely unprofessional heart emoji and a message like "" {your name} is on signal, say hey!"" A few of my contacts got this unintended outreach text when I upgraded my phone. This app also constantly prompts me to invite each person onto signal whenever I send any text to anyone not on signal. Since the ""invite""box takes up 4-5 lines (1/6th ) of my Nexus 5x 5.2"" screen, there is a good chance I will accidentally click it inadvertantly at some point, unless I  uninstall this app, since like their other forced outreaches being from my phone, I don't seem to have any way to turn these off, and I need to click to close an ""invite"" screen pop-up that blocks a chunk of my screen every time I use signal to send a text. Crazy, stupid, that I can't block these pop-ups on my own phone,  and a completely unprofessional outreach to my business contacts, as I mentioned above."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,95.64024390243901,2,130,"The ""make profile visible"" issue is a constant source of frustration for all the users on my signal threads. On my (android) phone, I get a pop up window when I first join or start a thread which lets me make my profile visible but once done, there is no way view that setting. If you have several threads, it's hard to remember if you did that and impossible to verify that you did it correctly. We all end up spending a good deal of our time asking each other if you can see see my name and telling each other to access settings that either don't exist or are practically impossible to find. I think it may be different for iphone users because some on the thread swear that it's available any time but I've spent well over an hour on my phone trying every possible icon to no avail. Other users who don't have that problem are annoyed that they can't see my profile probably think I'm just not able to figure it out. Please just make a simple button in settings for all users of both platforms to make the profile visible!"

I replied to a message on screen (not in app); message continued to pop up about 5+ times as though the message had not been read. Opened app and viewed messages; did not stop the notification.   - Over the span of approximately 3-4 consecutive months, messages were deleted from device; was not configured to do so.  - Contacts who are messaged often (daily) no longer appear when typing their name or in the âquick listâ. Sought to resolve this by adding â1â before area code as one forum had suggested, but this did not help; still have to go in through device Contacts to select and message contact.  - SMS and MMS from Signal to Signal users not received.  SMS from non-Signal user received during this same time frame. Perhaps a carrier issue."

A feature request to the dev would be to add columns for each of my lists.  Apart from all that, here's the main inconvenience: Even after today's speed improvement update where the dev gets updates in 3-5 seconds, it's still taking about a minute or 2 for my updates to appear.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,83.77032520325201,2,1,"Signal was okay. At first off putting because its totally misleading that sends encrypted SMS. It invites you to set it as the default for SMS messages. It then defaults to sending online messages to any contacts who also have a Signal account EVEN IF BOTH YOU AND YOUR CONTACT IS OFF LINE at the time. It's possible to change this on contact at a time by long pressing the send button and switching to SMS. Then also go back manually later when your both online. This is not easy to discover. The app does not show if your contact is online or not. I used this for years, but quit when I realised the feature to export plain text messages from the app was silently removed. It's possible to move messages to a new phone, but not possible to sync two Signal databases. If you have two you must choose. This was a deal killer for me."
org.mariotaku.twidere,83.23780487804878,2,3,"Went from great, to simply functional This was the best twitter app I'd ever used. However after a ""recent"" update, the tab images were gone, the compose button was floating around, and when you tried to view the replies to a tweet, nothing would happen.

Sometimes I still get a push notification in my status bar, even when I have the conversation open already on my screen (MMS group conversations). 2. Renaming of MMS group chats - please allow this. Would like to see things like ""Fantasy Football League"" or ""Army Platoon"" in my inbox instead of a list of names that's cut off. 3. Pin conversations to top of inbox (for both Signal conversations and SMS/MMS) - please add this. 4. Any sort of customization of the look/feel AT ALL. The default contact colors and chat bubbles look like trash in dark mode (magenta, forest green, etc). I understand your main goal is to provide secure messaging, but adding a few simple features that I listed above would really polish off the app and serve as a total messaging replacement for any mobile device."

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,81.86382113821138,2,11,"Every new version brings UI enhancements and new features. Up until recently, these features were good. Now I'm finding performance issues while searching contacts for new messages, and I'm still bothered that you cannot send encrypted text messages. Changing the phone call button to default to the in call action is annoying, because I rarely have good service here, so I have yet to even complete a successful signal call. Latest update is great. Dropped a star for hassling me to invite every contact to signal.  Long story short, I'm extremely disappointed how far from their roots they have gone.

I have two major complaints: 1) starting new and finding past group messages is not intuitive. I'd usually want to start using the pencil button at the bottom, but could only add one recipient. Then I'd remember to go back to the top right button and start a new group message. It would then ask me to name the group, at which point I'd think, ""oh, maybe I already have this group saved"". Id then search for that group message for several minutes only to give up. 2) Reliability. I would guess maybe 25% of my photo, video of group messages would go through. Only some of the people on groups would get my messages. On individual messages, some of my pictures wouldn't go through. I wouldn't have realized they weren't if the recipients hadn't texted me back saying they got a blank message. The limit for video sizes is also difficult to work with."

Honestly, though, I don't feel I need these features, and given the choice to opt out, if you don't need them, don't opt in as that will bring you ads, which is contrary to its original mission of a Twitter client without ads.

Again, I'm still using it since I can't think of another Twitter app that is as open-source, free and with truly no ads because putting the 'promotions reward' (for the additional features) upset me because that's going to bring ads.

This app's design reflects that. Signal forces you to use your phone number as your identity, which means you can't remain anonymous.

The first: some vehicles send out an automated text via Bluetooth that says ""I'm driving."" when the user is operating a vehicle and receives a text. This feature does not work with this app. In fact it appears anything sending texts via Bluetooth does not work, so people that communicate hands free are out of luck. Next, if your WiFi strength is weak, the app can't send or receive texts which I think is dangerous. In fact the app doesn't even show me my contact names,  just phone numbers. Once I get better WiFi or sign off WiFi altogether,  it works correctly again.  They need to change it so if a message can't be sent in WiFi,  it falls back to cellular.

Here is why, Number 1, you can't send multiple media items at once, this was tried in a group chat. Number 2, if the media file fails to send there is no resend option, you have to physically go and search for that one specific item and resend it AGAIN, of which some of them failed to send more than three times. Number 3, I have sent multiple voice notes through the built in voice note function, and it has failed miserably, when i have recorded a voice note and it fails to send, it does not have the retry option, the whole voice note is broken, you can't even replay YOUR OWN DAMN VOICE NOTE, it becomes useless. The voice note feature has failed me miserably at one of the times i most needed it. This app has a very long way to go before it is on the WhatsApp standard.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,70.25,2,2,"Reliability and usability is more important than security for average users.  Encrypted calls and texts use data, which is fine, but this means they don't send when data is disabled or out-of-range. It's really annoying to try and get to the normal call/text mode when the Signal calls fail due to Internet issues.  Please, if a message doesn't send over data after a set timeout, or a Signal call fails, Signal should prompt to ask to try again in normal non-encrypted mode.  It's also more tedious to call people who don't use Signal, as the call doesn't begin automatically after pressing call if the other person is not on Signal, it just prefills their number. This difference in behaviour on the same UI is frustrating.  A different colour for each person is jarring: I would prefer one colour for secure and one colour for insecure communications.

If you're unemployed or retired and have the time or the inclination to try and get useless things to work, this problem-disguised-as-an-app might entertain you. On the other hand if you're a competent professional whose role requires reliable resources that facilitate immediate, clear communication from your colleagues and allies in the field then stay FAR away from this rubbish.

Unfortunately the experience of using Talon is simply a chore. Tap tap tap. So many extra taps to do basic tasks. Hardly any options for tweaking outside of font choices/colors, so what you see is what you get. Liking/RT requires you to expand a tweet or tap a small hidden area for quick actions - it would be far quicker to simply have small buttons already in the timeline, or at least able to quickly expand without having to tap a tiny area (with no icon indicating it is there, I only discovered it by accident). Expanding a tweet in a conversation, for whatever reason, only loads the first 2-3 tweets. You have to then tap ""show all"" to actually see the conversation that the expanded tweet is a part of. I'm unsure why the developer just doesn't show the full conversation on the first tap. On top of that, conversations are unintuitively shown. When you tap a tweet in a conversation, it doesn't show the tweet & its place within the conversation, it shows the tweet isolated, requiring you to tap ""show all"" again to see the full conversation. Talon is form over function."

I get a lot of notifications from various apps, so it's really easy for me to clear the notification panel without noticing that I received a text. I've missed quite a few texts that I didn't know I had until I opened the app to send one, or because I've gotten a new one.

A few non-core functions, such as emoji support and complete camera support are a little behind some other messengers.  ===  UPDATE: June 2017  Signal notifications seem to be hit and miss on some devices - I've convinced a couple of friends to use it only them to report that they consistently do not receive messages unless they check the application directly.

I'm not going to use this app any longer and will no longer be recommending this app to others. Your other apps are great however.   I thought this app would be great. It definitely looked the part. Unfortunately I am receiving immense battery drain even with Talon Pull off. It's silly and I'm not sure why. I've even turned syncing off entirely. I really want to use Talon Pull but it's not the same as receiving notifications like from the normal Twitter app. The other issue is when you're tagging people, why do random users show up instead of users that you follow or tag more often? It needs to be slightly similar to Twitter in that regard. I tweeted a picture a few days ago but couldn't find it on my twitter timeline. It was only visible on the desktop or normal Twitter app. If I could claim a refund now I would but sadly I've passed the date for reimbursement. Not happy with this app. I'm going back to the original Twitter app for now. Main killer for me was not being able to receive push notifications.

Also, everytime I install this, either because I got a new phone or reimaged my phone, it completely butchers my contacts. Some of them go missing, most of them are then duplicated.

For example: I switched from Samsung's default SMS app to signal, I was missing days worth of messaging with my Japanese fiend. I switch back to Samsung's SMS, now a group conversation shows only 2 messages from the 57 that we just sent each other today.... I've emailed the devs."
org.mariotaku.twidere,47.768292682926834,1,2,"Broken since last update Cant choose profile to twit from, compose now doesnt work. Last update is bad, please fix otherwise excellent app!"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.764227642276424,2,9,"It's OK. But not being able to send multiple pics at one time, not seeing a name populate when you use the 'add contact' option, and other silly things are holding it back from being great. I also wish we could turn off the 'invite to signal' on all 100 threads in my messages. You don't want us annoyed with your app. Update 2/13/19 No changes."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.71747967479675,2,0,"Buggy Several times this app resent texts that were originally sent to me back to the sender several hours later.  For example someone texted me ""How's it going?"" at noon today, and then at 8pm my phone sent him ""How's it going?"" This change was reflected in the conversation history, too--as if he'd never sent it to me in the first place. Very bizarre and pretty confusing.  Also, it only encrypts texts if both myself and my intended recipient are using the app. I uninstalled."
org.mariotaku.twidere,47.6829268292683,3,0,Good UI but takes a long time to sync The UI is brilliant but it takes a little longer to get new notifications and home tab doesn't refresh unless I restart the app.
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.65040650406504,2,46,"I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. I have a contact that I used to communicate through Signal with, but they no longer use the app. Now, when they send me messages, I recieve them, but when I message them, they don't receive my messages; presumably because my messages are going to their signal number over the net (through the encrypted tunnel), instead of their actual cell network number. How can we remedy this issue? I will update my rating once this is resolved."
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,47.64634146341463,1,2,"editing the review after using the app for 5-6 days and it's not worth buying. 1. DMs will always disappoint, disappearance of chats if you log out of app, loading issue, and also if you use official twitter website on desktop to send some message, that msg wont get loaded in the convo in this app. 2. can't recognise navigation bar, doesn't work even after changing settings. 3. can't catch notification from twitter app either, tried many times. 4. link previews load very slow, links open fine"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.61585365853658,1,0,"Be aware that your SMS messages will not be private with this app - they will either have to go via the centralized Signal servers (with metadata accessible even to google) or not be encrypted at all.  Since becoming a ""private messenger"" rather than a secure SMS app, it also doesn't work as expected anymore: if you, the sender, and your counterpart, the one you are sending to, are both registered with signal but you (the sender) do not have a network connection (even temporarily), it won't SEND your message anymore. You have to change to ""send unsecured message"" before sending.  This project has completely gotten off track by centralization and aiming to be a cheap copy of WhatsApp. If you just want encrypted SMS, go and use Silence instead. If you want encrypted phone calls add Tox or Linphone to that. But if you care for your privacy do not use Signal.   This app - for what it claims it is as opposed to what it really is - currently deserves 0 stars."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.61585365853658,1,0,Too much emphasis on unnecessary security ..this is not the Secret Service! Annoyingly keeps asking to prove you remember your PIN that you are forced to create. Read all of my contacts and sent messages to other app users without my consent. Same product as Whatsapp except too much unneeded security. Will never recommend this app. Only reason it's still on my phone is because a friend insisted it be used because she didn't trust any other apps to not data mine her. My phone just got data mined!
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.61585365853658,1,0,"Awful for those that live in areas with patchy signal. If I send a message when I have no signal, rather than waiting until the phone has signal to re-attempt the send it seems to endlessly attempt to send it in a loop which then triggers the text limit warning locking my phone in an endless loop of clicking accept and the message instantly re-appearing until I find signal. Don't really fancy installing a custom ROM just to vary the text limit to use the app."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.61585365853658,3,8,"i was really enjoying this messenger, i even use it as my standart sms app. After an update, i can't see anymore, who of my contacts is using signal. I'm a little bit disapointed right now. this means minus one star :(. EDIT: the desktop apps updates once a week and needs a long time to load. quite anoying. minus an additional star"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.5650406504065,2,6,"It's great that it's secure, but as far as usability is concerned, this app does need improvement. Can't start a message without first selecting a contact. Can't send to more than one recipient without first creating a group. Can't unarchive a message, .... UI matters! Please try to bring it up to the level of other messaging apps."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.416666666666664,2,1,"I choose to boycott WhatsApp because they've sold theyre souls. Heard about signal. Its ok, love the privacy aspect of it but bugs with audio file errors which is getting very tiresome!!! Sort this pls. no indication of how long a voice note is, no way of closing screen whilst listening to a voice note whilst browsing another page. Will up to 5 stars if bugs are fixed. Other than that, privacy is the MAIN importance otherwise would probably still use WhatsApp."
org.mariotaku.twidere,47.37804878048781,3,2,"great potential, but... 1- It's not 100% smooth, almost there, a little lag when scrolling vertically. 2- Adding a 'Favorites' column doesn't show nothing, it keeps refreshing and blank 3- Profile images should be centered in profile pages 4- I would like to display smaller profile avatars in the timeline"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.3109756097561,2,16,"Works good if you just want to use it as a replacement messaging service on your phone. The second I started using it on multiple devices I started getting major sync issues, sent messages would not appear elsewhere and I stopped getting notifications. The only way to fix the issue was to delete the app and redownload, but the problems continued. I wanted this to be the replacement messaging service for all others but it simply does not work as good as any of the others do."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.26829268292683,3,0,"This app has a lot of potential however, I would like to make a few suggestions. The app only has the ability to take a photo via the camera icon, if the developer could add the ability to hold the ""take picture"" button down so the app starts recording video like WhatsApp, also the ability to change each users colour (received message background), and wallpaper theme (like in WhatsApp) would be great. Also the ability to double tap sent/received message to like (so a heart appears next to the message) like Instagram does would be awesome."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.26829268292683,3,0,Pluses and Minuses Like the color coding feature for your contacts. Like the encryption factor. Like that the internal camera feature will not save photos to gallery. Group text is not very easy to use and forwarding doesnt work. Phone call feature works much better now though.
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.264227642276424,1,3,"Yknow this a great idea but it misses all the features of a stock messenger. Wanna send gif reactions? Not with signal, everything is too large. Wanna accept vcards and easily put them in contacts. Nope! How about clicking an address and getting placed into your GPS. Not a chance. So if you want a messenger that's reminds you of the old sidekick then have at it. As for me this is getting removed from my phone. Really want this to be improved so I can go back to using again. Great idea, bad app."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.264227642276424,2,7,"People who've deleted the app need to unregister their # which makes it a pain for people who still have the app to text people who've uninstalled Signal. Switching between secure and ""unsecured"" text is total bs, it should be an automatic preference between non Signal users. If it wasn't for these problems I'd rate 5 stars. Message capacity is too small, can't send photos/memes to non Signal users."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.264227642276424,1,3,utter garbage. lost texts with no clear indication or reason why. broken encryption reset pain. and a nightmare if anyone you k own gets a new phone or decides not to use Signal anymore. group messages are awful as well. this app is for drug dealers. it's garbage for everyone else.
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.260162601626014,1,14,There's no option to set a contact as a non-signal user. If a signal contact uninstall the app it keeps defaulting to secure messaging and they'll never get your messages or calls.   You can longpress to send insecure messages but the call button can't be changed.   The transport method also resets back to secure after changing it with longpress.  Sorry for the 1 star but this makes the app frustrating after at least one frequent contact removes signal.
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.2479674796748,1,47,Seems like a great app and I would like to give it a try. Unfortunately when setting up I saw that my profile would be shared with all my contacts automatically. Ridiculous! I don't want every contact to have that information. Also some of my saved contacts are for businesses or strictly professional contacts and sharing this information would be inappropriate and/or unprofessional. Due to losing MY RIGHT to choose who in my contact list I want share this information with I am uninstalling.
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.21747967479675,3,2,"Decent, but needs work. Not as refined as WhatsApp. Numerous bugs. Some issues: 1) often I can't play a received audio message. Have to save it externally, & play from outside Signal. 2) it bloats massively. Signal is currently taking 3.2gb of internal storage. No way to move it to external sdcard. Can't easily save all the media files in bulk, to reduce its size. So It cripples my phone due to full storage. Can't use built in signal backups for same reason.(reached end of review limit)"
org.mariotaku.twidere,47.213414634146346,1,3,Updated the app and now images and Gifs don't load. How do you update and ruin the app more? Fix it please
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,47.166666666666664,3,4,Signal is a good app but it also lack some features like using a user ID to not be bound to sharing your phone number. Or you as a group Armin don't have any control over the group. And at last there is no group video and voice call
