Is there a bar code I can find somewhere in nature that gives me access to a special proxy?? Come on, man. I'd love to hear your explanation for this one. I will continue to question this move and your excuses until you reveal what you're really trying to do or stop trying to creep on us!"

I had to download a code reader program, open and program the settings to their specifications, then had to open the code reader and scan, open K9 mail, try to send an email so it would recreate the code, and the code reader would recreate the code. Then I had to plug the phone into the computer, download a certain file, then mail it to K9.  The code reader ran for a full 24 hours showing nothing, before I repeated the process.  I sent K9 Mail support team a detailed email about my trouble, then said to, ""can you please respond within 48hours with a solution, I use my email for work and will be on a out of state trip in two days and need it, if you cant respond I will have to download another client and use their services"".  THEY DIDNT RESPOND. 10 days later...still have not. After using Aquamail for a week...I LOVE IT..more that I could have ever thought. Uninstalled!"
com.fsck.k9,8.85,2,1,"Looks Promising, No Good Yet Though As with many programs about today, for all systems not just mobile devices, the idea looks good and some of the basics look great. Beyond that important features seem to not get looked at and the community tends to stop fixing and keep adding more broken features.   There are several issues which make this unusable, it won't open attachments, it corrupts attachments when forwarding mail, Bcc doesn't work properly and that is as far as I've got so far, I only sent 10 mails, 9 of which were test mails.  I like the features, even though they don't work. The reason I installed K9 was because HTC mail doesn't do what I want it to so I have a choice, use HTC mail and not have any of the features I want or use K9 and have the features but accept the fact that none of them work and it could all come crashing down at any moment. I use my email a lot for work, I would happily pay for a working version of K9, same as I would happily pay for a working version of many free but not quite working programs\apps.  I'll keep an eye on this, but like many other programs and apps I have used\installed in the past, I doubt anything will happen in the next 10 Years."
com.fsck.k9,9.3,1,0,"Could be a lot better One of the reasons I stopped using K-9 Mail a while back is because I check multiple accounts throughout the day but I like to have it automated. I wanted an email client that could check my email accounts at certain times of the day, like every two hours, between certain times of the day, like between noon and 8pm and no other times. This can't be done with K-9. You have to set up each email account to check every so often, say every two hours. If you check like six accounts, you have to change these setting for each account and you can't dictate a specific time but only the time frequency. For example, if you want to set all accounts to check at 8pm, you have to wait until 8pm to set the first one and by the time you're done setting the last one, it's way after 8pm. This feature should be in the Global Settings and have the ability to over-ride the account settings.   Basically I want an email client that works the way SnapperMail works on the Palm platform. Another thing: I can't seem to ever save any kind of attachments to the SD Card, even though the button is there. When I tap on Save, I get a message that states my attachment can't be saved."
com.fsck.k9,10.25,2,3,"Good email app; battery drain As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. It's flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with.  However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of ""keep awake"" time (even though I hadn't opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that I'd used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the ""keep awake"" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU.  The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I don't know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not.  I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - I'll probably give it another try."

I don't receive that many emails to justify that, absolutely no way! Since I use other apps as well that use internet connection, I'm now near the limit of my 750MB monthly allowance and I'm afraid to use my phone.  There is a 'data killer' for K-9 to control data movement but that doesn't work for my phone, the gs3, as you can read from the user reviews. So, there is really no solution around it.    I first tried to raise a call with them about the lack of sync options in K-9 and how it's increasingly consuming data and the Data killer thing doesn't work! They replied to me that what I'm saying should be logged under 'enhancements' and not 'support' so they disregarded my log. Yeah, right.

com.fsck.k9,8.7,1,0,"For years, this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways, demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now, unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client, it will appear below the list of unread messages, completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions, but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent.   There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way, and messages read in K-9 in another way, is just extremely poor development, and it needs to be fixed."

Other systems can do so.  The reason I need this feature is that I run a small business and -- like many other people -- have kept old business emails on my server,  So, whenever I remove new emails from my phone and then sync to the server, these old emails populate the phone.  I need to be able to have a feature to globally remove those old emails from my phone without deleting them from the server, and without deleting my new emails.  The only way I can do so now is by globally putting a check box next to EVERY email currently displayed on my phone, then manually removing the check box from recent emails, and then deleting what remains checked.  This can be tedious since I get about 150 emails a day, and want to be able to keep the last 2 weeks' emails on my phone. 2- To add insult to injury, once I manually deleted emails from 2011-2012 from my phone, old emails from 2010 started appearing in my phone inbox as if they were sent to me today."

However, recently I've noticed a glitch of some sort with regards to replying to group emails.  I took the time to explain the situation thoroughly in an email to the developers via the link to contact them on Google Play-- except turns out that only gets you a canned response to go to their Github forum.  So I did that, took the time to create an account, and explained my issue there. It sat for 3 days and got no response.  I went to their Google+ forum, took the time to create a Google+ account, and posted there. Got no answer.  I went back to Github and bumped my thread, got an irrelevant answer from someone that didn't solve the problem, and he immediately closed the thread. So, this was great while it lasted, but it's impossible to get assistance when something isn't right.

It appears to have no setting to leave incoming mail on the server (a pop3 feature which has existed for decades) so the most recent messages now only exist on my phone (the very reason I asked it not to poll, and the reason I have already deleted the app). It kept downloading messages when no poll and no sync had been requested.  The other major feature missing in my native email client, intelligent recognition of phone numbers and other details in mail bodies, appears to be partially implemented, but selecting a number doesn't show you what you have selected, and doesn't prompt what you want to do with, it simply takes you to the dialler and pastes the number there.

So, for example, if you have a FILE on your server called myFile.php K9 picks this up as another email folder ! Seriously bad bit of design there. You have to manually select each error and mark it as ""2nd class"" to hide it (no multi-select option) - there is no apparent way to tell K9 to actually remove it.  Another issue - minor, but irritating - is if you click on an email with the intention of opening it, instead of opening it you instead get a list of emails from the same person. OK, so you can then click on the email AGAIN in this new list to actually ropen it but what an un-necessary step. Not a disaster, just annoying.

In any case, use of IMAP is hindered, because the app seems to try to read the whole messages prior to showing them in the folder, even if you tell it not to.

It apparently just churns away.  Side note:  I can't stand the new icon.  The older one was a bit odd and kitschy but it was comfortable and familiar.  The battery issue would get any other app a 1 or 2 star rating, but since K-9 is the only app I still use, that I used on my first android, it gets a slight pass (along with hope that it will be fixed.)"
com.fsck.k9,10.5,1,6,"Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data — hardly ideal —  but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is insane! Having persevered with this for years, I've now given up, uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store."

I greatly appreciate being able to export settings, & receipts, & many other features.    Other than the need to fix crash problem,  I can only suggest 3 things:    1. Allow messages  to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date;  like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones.   2. Allow to only download headers;  again like default email app.   3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone.  Especially when setup as an IMAP connection."

I went to the Unified Inbox and there was my Exchange email. I started to explore, and went into the inbox for the Exchange account. At this point, the messages were downloaded again. Returning to the Unified Inbox, all of the messages were duplicated--two of each. I checked the folder list under the Exchange account and there are two inboxes listed. Why? I uninstalled and reinstalled... messages get duplicated in the same folder. It's ridiculous. Then I added another account, used the ""move up"" option to rearrange the accounts in the list, and it *duplicated* the account!"

But I can't live with how the new version messes up my IMAP account, with messages showing up on the phone, but absent from my PC mail clients.

Similar things happen with other emails like gmail.

Images are almost always corrupt or not showing without alot of tampering. When you delete in the app, the server doesn't get the call. When you check email on your computer, it's still there.

The new update also has a strange behavior with notifications. When I am notified off a single new email, tapping the notification opens the email directly instead of taking me to the inbox.

I have tried a few in the 4.3 category and they are still giving me the new interface.

From the looks of the bug trackers, neither will be forthcoming anytime soon, which is sad because it's actually a rather nice program otherwise.

com.fsck.k9,8.95,3,15,"One major problem Good app except I want to have all my emails stored on my external SD card.  Yes, I know there's an option to store to the external card, and I have it switched on, but on my phone, internal storage is called sdcard0 and the external card is called sdcard1.  K-9 does not seem to be able to differentiate between the two, and, thus, over a gig of emails are being stored internally and taking up valuable space.  There needs to be an option to let the user specify the storage path."
com.fsck.k9,8.8,3,0,Mail font size problem For some reason my phone updated to the latest release without my permission. The font size doesn't work well with this version. The size of the font varies from email to email. Seems like it used to always be the same size. If I pick a size of normal the text on some emails is too small. But if I pick larger it's too large on other emails. I can pinch to zoom in but then I have to scroll left and right to read the email. None of these problems with the last version I had.
com.fsck.k9,7.0,3,0,"Used for years but must look around again now I'm adding a second account. K9 has a crazy nest of menus, hard to find the setting you want, confusing folders, no dedicated help file, making it a PITA. OTOH, I have found it can wrap & display text better than some, where only option was to zoom in & pan around, & I don't want to lose that. A much simpler UI & menu would transform this into an unbeatable app I'd even pay for, but it's like herding cats. Last update to K9 was 2018, not acceptable."
com.fsck.k9,7.9,1,4,"Had horrible experience in the part with this app, but frankly all Android email apps are garbage. Thought I'd try it again: Nope. 1) error about working with Android 10; 2) won't authenticate with Google for my Gmail. If you don't work with Google on TWO levels, What business do you have making an Android app? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Edit: just got an email from Google saying they blocked an unsecured attempt to log in to my email. WOW. You know it's bad when Google blocks someone else because of security!"
com.fsck.k9,8.6,2,0,"Serious looping issues Works fine most of the time but, apparently by faulty design, gets stuck in loops when something doesn't go it's way. One example is a failed send. It will try forever to get the message sent that results in persistent notifications with a rapid blinking notification light that eats battery. The message is no longer in the out box so there's no way to stop it. There's also no setting for disabling that notification. The only resolution is to disable or uninstall the app."
com.fsck.k9,6.85,1,1,"I have used this app for several years because Verizon quit email and Internet services, and wanted to keep my email address. This week K-9 stopped working again, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. It now doesn't recognize POP3 server. K-9 has quit working still again and won't accept either the incoming OR outgoing email settings. Please help if you can. Otherwise, I wish there was another similar app that I could switch to. For now, I have no email app and am not getting email. Thank you."
com.fsck.k9,10.7,2,0,"2013: Truly wanted app to work. It has more features than many other mail programs and a nice UI for viewing emails. What I don't like is the unreliability. Email won't push, error messages that you can't read fully, messages just sit in my outbox and NEVER get sent. I'll check the bug list to see what's there but it would be nice to know what all these random error codes mean and to read the whole problem somewhere - like a log. 2020: Tried again but must know server settings to add account."
com.fsck.k9,9.3,1,0,"Terrible update This newest version sacrifices speed and features for...a better look, maybe? I don't know. It's much slower at displaying email, and the number of options available on one touch has been reduced. Sure, I can still move email around, but it's multi-click- why do I want that on a phone? Beats me. Someone on the dev team though ""good looks"" should beat out ""works great"". I'll be shopping for another email program. This is the first time I've 1-starred an app I previously loved."
com.fsck.k9,5.7,3,2,"Love the interface, hate the battery drain Great interface to keep on top of 3 email accounts.   Reluctantly had to turn off the push notifications which I loved as it was sucking the life out of my battery and making the phone so hot I could fry an egg on the back.  Now working fine with polling every 30 minutes. Would be good to have some warning about possible side effects of Push with this app as it took me hours of research to diagnose the problem, only to find out I'm not the only one."
com.fsck.k9,10.75,1,7,"Been great until three days ago and it just stopped working. Rebooted phone. Reinstalled. Nothing. It goes to load messages from hotmail and the progress wheel just spins and spins...nothing. UPDATE - never got a response from the developer. But tried it again later. Quirky. Some messages just do not come through at all. it has actually been some very crucial ones as well. The current problem I have, is now, after I read a message, it disappears, deleted from stored messages. Very Very bad."
com.fsck.k9,3.6999999999999997,3,0,"If it ain't broke... Like many have noted, the latest update appears broken. Main issues, for me, are account sizes now showing arbitrary large values even when completely empty & that the app now appears randomly laggy. In particular, zooming & panning are often unresponsive & are very erratic when they do respond. Shouldn't be like this in current phones like Samsung Galaxy S7. Really liked this app, so please roll back & fix issues in meantime. Looking forward to giving its 5 stars back."
com.fsck.k9,6.15,3,5,"Latest update causing issues Ever since the update I get daily errors about an invalid certificate. But if I go to the account screen and connect, all is fine.   The really odd thing, is that K-9 has NO option to accept any certificate. All implementations of OpenSSL allow you to accept any cert and encrypt the channel - K-9 should have this, and just ignore any potential errors. I am not worried about a MitM attack, so just quit nagging me - or if there is a real error, tell me what it is."
com.fsck.k9,5.6,2,0,"Ok-ish Using this because default email wont connect to 1and1, this did. great. Problem is i cant get this to connect to hotmail.co.uk. tried every setting possible and many forum suggestions. THIS common email should be correct as default out of the box, very poor that common email providers do not setup 1st time, no hassle by default. very poor. Also no feedback links in program, or if there too well hidden.   2 points, no or hidden help/feedback. and no auto setup even for big providers."
com.fsck.k9,9.7,1,10,"8 years ive used this app. now I'm over it. repeated tickets have been raised for the continued syncing issues. repeated blame deflection from user fault to android/power issue. just admit you can't fix it. one of your developers public posted they're aware but repeated reports aren't helpful. that was a year ago and yet the problem remains current. some people might like an app that can't poll unless you tell it to, but if it's supposed to, and doesn't, that's something that needs fixing!"
com.fsck.k9,3.4,3,0,"Nice app but NO Exchange support I liked K-9 and was looking forward to using it, but couldn't. I use Gmail, yahoo and for work Exchange.  While I could successfully connect K-9 to Gmail and Yahoo, it does not connect and work with corp Exchange.  It is unfortunate the app description doesn't openly state this and in fact has a false claim about Exchange support in its description.  It would be a great app if Exchange was supported.  Does anyone know the real scoop on its exchange support?"
com.fsck.k9,6.6,2,4,"TLDR: Functional, but broken. This is no longer my primary email app, as the sole dev (his choice to refuse any fixes!) has obviously abandoned it. The number of issues that are simply being ignored is getting silly - this is NOT an open source project, just a ""source available"" one. I used to advise anyone that asked to install K9, but can't do that any more. Dropped mails, useless notifications, broken config, stuck outgoing messages, poor code quality (shown by power usage). Now a PoS!"
com.fsck.k9,6.1,3,0,"Better but not without glitches. Quick scrolling in messages list lagging quite bad, even in phones with so many cores, outrageous RAM & lots of storage space. Super slow when searching old mail in online folder. When an inbox is open, new mail come & opened not from notification, the notification wont go away until manually cleared or reopen mail by tapping the notification. Deleting mail directly from notification causes screen to unlock. Fixes & improvements will be highly anticipated."
com.fsck.k9,30.1,2,74,"Sadly, K-9 is no longer up to the task of it's main function. I've used it for many, many years but since Android 7 it's failed me regularly across three phones. Mostly this means it won't sync mail status nor deletions on some accounts. It will simply disable sync and not let it work again even after removing the account and re-adding. Removing and reinstalling the app shortly results in the same failure. It hasn't been updated in too long, so I put the blame there. Good bye, sweet K-9."
com.fsck.k9,6.199999999999999,1,2,"I am trying K-9 Mail for the first time as the developer of Open Keychain s h ows it as a suggested app. I must say I am disgusted that even though I have my key associated with the K-9 app, I am unable to send a signed and encrypted email to my ProtonMail account. My ProtonMail is 4096-bit encrypted and my OpenKeychain PGP key (associated to K-9) is also 4096-bit. So why the popup saying it cannot be encrypted due to one or more recipients...?

Uninstalling K9Mail stopped the problems, and made everything else on the phone MUCH more responsive. Re-installing K9Mail brought all the problems back.

com.fsck.k9,5.5,3,0,"New update appears ok The new update appears to be OK but not spectacular. I don't like the circles that denote whether an item has been read or not - they just waste screen space, the old vertical strip was much better. Please reinstate the old view for those that want it. Also, when I use the notification to view my unread messages, it claims that I'm viewing the inbox - I'm definitely not. Reloading appears to reload the inbox, not the list of unread items! Good but could try harder."

It drops messages (they're sitting in my inbox on other computers, but k9 never gets them), it doesn't synchronize the read and archived status to the server for hours, it has trouble sending emails, and sync never works (always disabled) It was a great open source project but I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere now. I appreciate all the work the community has put into the app, so long!"

Sorry but I don't like inconsistent apps. So I am looking for an alternative."

I didn't like the fact that you have to access the menu to send an email, etc. There should be on screen buttons for common actions.  I also found the account menu confusing.  I van see others liking it but it didn't work for me.  Actually I find mail more readable when I access it through the browser. I'd love to find an app that looks like that."

However, I wish I could use labels with my gmail accounts instead of having it call them ""folders"" because it doesn't quite work the same.

I don't know what they thought they were fixing but I'm going to another mail client until this one stabilizes."
com.fsck.k9,12.25,1,7,"*EDIT!! Moderately new bug!!!!!* Usually LOVE this app - ALL I use, for MANY years ... but major problem with last update!! Outgoing emails will NOT send unless I'm on wifi (3G and 4G working fine, but emails won't sent, get stuck in outbox until wifi goes on (getting notification saying problem sending this email). Usually goes out perfectly fine once on wifi. This is a NEW problem!!  ****I'm hoping the makers will see this review and fix this*** PLEASE!!??"
com.fsck.k9,9.2,1,2,"Uninstalled after update Was a great app but ever since the update, I keep getting certificate errors even though everything is configured correctly. Very annoying that my notification bar is filled with these false positive error messages. Also I noticed my battery drains faster because of always getting the errors. I uninstalled and did a Google search for top email clients and moved over to Blue Mail. Couldn't be happier and no more stupid error messages!"

I found through searching that many others are having the same issue and patiently tried several suggested setting changes to fix the problem.  Sometimes it seems to fix for 1 or 2 tries but then the same problem returns.  I really like the app but I like to be able to send my emails much more.  I wish the problem could be resolved."
com.fsck.k9,3.8,2,0,What on earth? Recently saw massive battery drain and it somehow managed to use 2gb of data in a couple of hours which meant I had to buy more mobile data. Couldn't stop the app so restarted everything. It's a bit better but still chewing through data (not as bad as before but still much more than previpusly)  checked all my emails no massive attachments or anything like that. If it keeps happening I'm offski. I can't afford to keep buying data for my phone

When composing a new email then highlighting text to be edited, the Select all, Copy, Paste, WebSearch buttons at the top of screen cannot be seen because they're covered with black.  The buttons are still there, but you have to guess where the button positions are. If you touch the correct button position all works fine, but this needs to be fixed."
com.fsck.k9,3.4,3,0,"No PGP/MIME, complex settings I like this client. A couple nits that might or might not be important to you:  The settings seem overly complex, but I suppose to some extent this might be justified or even unavoidable given the flexibility.  There's no PGP/MIME support. This, to me, is the main weakness; I think a lot of people look into this client because it integrates with APG/etc.  I can't get IMAP IDLE to work. This might be just me/my server; not sure."
com.fsck.k9,4.0,3,0,"Great but where is the search? This app is awesome. It's lightweight, fast, and packed with features. My only two issues are that my galaxy S3 has no hard search button and without that I cannot search k9 mail. The other issue is that there is no manual check mail button in the unified inbox view. The app does not automatically check your mail boxes when you access the app. It will only run on the schedule and via manual check on each account individually."
com.fsck.k9,5.85,2,1,"Has become unusable with Android 10 (though I'm not sure that's why). As noted in a GitHub bug report, a red lock icon with an X through it appears in upper left of composing screen (on the From: line). Attempting to send shows: ""Cannot connect to crypto provider, check your settings or click crypto icon to retry!"" I've uninstalled and reinstalled, with no success. Was very happy with this software and will upgrade the rating when/if the bug is resolved."
com.fsck.k9,6.45,2,1,"Since updating this app in mid July 2017, there have been several occasions when a message has not been sent by the app but the app has not kept a copy in the outbox, so only after checking with people have I become aware a message was not sent.  This unreliability is a serious flaw.  I had not experienced it in my5 years of using this app up until mid July 2017.  Please attend to this failure.  If it happens again I will migrate to another email client."

This account is set with webdav/owa. I tried deleting the app data and reconfiguring the account but the double mail notifications still appear. Also more often than not, the app stops synchronizing for no apparent reason. It says ""next synch at xx"" but when the time comes no action is done."

Considerable battery drain (much more significant than prior version). My battery can't even last a day as a result of this upgrade.  2. More frequent crashes/force closes.  3. Application now really bogs down phone. Incredibly slow at times.  I liked previous versions, but have uninstalled this until it is fixed."

This seems to happen randomly (will work with one email but not the next) but still keeps happening if I try again. I'm on full WiFi coverage at home so there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. How can I fix this? Or better yet is there a setting to make it automatically download the complete message?
com.fsck.k9,10.2,1,18,"Won't work on gmail accounts unless you check to ""Allow less secure apps"" to run on my phone. That means ALL less secure apps run automatically if I just want to allow k-9 to run a gmail account. Either the k-9 developers need to make their app more secure to pass Google's standards or Google needs to let us individually choose a ""less secure app"" one at a time to run versus just doing a blanket ALL less secure apps can run just to allow k-9 to work."
com.fsck.k9,21.5,3,70,Defacto is a bit disappointing It's a well known mail client for a long time - almost the defacto standard for 3rd party Android mail clients perhaps. But it feels like it needs an interface overhaul. Just feels a bit dated and stale. Functionality is good but for me I found connectivity to exchange by owa far slower than other clients I've tried. Also it seems unable to deal properly with nested folders. Some folders I've been unable to see at all.
com.fsck.k9,5.85,2,1,"Doesn't fit screen I have to say that the email reader that came with my photon was easier to use in terms of deleting read mail until it stopped loading my aol email! With K9, I can now get my mail but the check boxes to the left do not show up unless I check ALL. Then i have to uncheck all the mail that i want to keep before deleting. That's the draw back for so far. Wonder if anyone else has that same problem of the picture not fitting on screen."
com.fsck.k9,25.4,3,82,"Would be 5 stars if not for frequent sync issues (it will say ""syncing disabled"" frequently though I have settings so that it should be syncing in the background all the time so as to not miss important emails when they come in) and often trying to send emails with any sort of attachment, regardless of attachment type or size, the emails will get stuck in the outbox for several hours and on some occasions even DAYS. Definitely room for improvement."
com.fsck.k9,10.55,2,21,Goodbye K9 Sad to uninstall K9 as I have used it for years. I like its visual approach among other things. But its become buggy/unstable and now I am faced with syncing disabled and no way to fix it. Emailed support and was directed to the manual and G+ community. No fix in manual and post to community asking for help unanswered. Had no choice but to make the switch to another email client for android. Sorry K9 but I guess all good things end. Bye!
com.fsck.k9,7.2,1,0,"New version pretty, but dumps features What happened to the spam button?    I also notice that when I do the whole set as spam through multiple menu clicks, it drops back to the previous message, even though I have it set to go to the next message.    Plus I can no longer tell whether I have an email or text message from the icon in the status bar.    On the whole I don't see a point to this release except a useless facelift and feature downgrade."
com.fsck.k9,5.55,2,1,hangs a lot. buggy since update i use this for business and to be honest im about to go back to the stock android app.  this app is getting buggier by the release. i have a galaxy note and hangs 50% of the time i use it. a forc e close is usual.  i appreciate this runs on many phones but for the love of god. buy some phones and do more testing before releasing an update.  ill give it a week and then im off.  all getting a bit mickey mouse for me.
com.fsck.k9,8.7,2,4,"Really doesn't like Hotmail. Better than the client that came with my Galaxy Tab (it displays HTML!) but having ongoing problems. Constantly having to mark emails as read AGAIN. Can't move items from trash back to inbox (why?!); other options to move items don't work; now suddenly showing only 4 emails instead of 50 despite the settings, which no longer seem to have any effect on anything. I'm  downgrading the star rating again; now only 2 stars."

I thought it was more complete based upon the reviews, but it seems the reviewers just don't know any better.  I will try it again when those features have been added."
com.fsck.k9,7.8,3,2,"Doesn't look right on tablet. DISCLAIMER: Google+ should not be needed to review free apps!   I would like to use K9, but I find the lines and fonts for message headers too closely spaced for comfort. Also, during a failed send, there is no way to force the email to resend. This is frustrating and should be a feature.   This makes twice I have tried K9 over the last two years and ended up uninstalling both times. (Once on phone, once on tablet.)"
com.fsck.k9,8.0,2,0,I like it but it has bugs The apparently was running great until a few weeks ago when it started showing that I had more email than I really had now all it does is continuously add to the numbers of email I have none of which are there. I works fine other than that. But it is getting really anoying. I can't clear the status bar of them and keep the notification bar clean. If the problem is not fixed then I am going back to the defualt gmail app.
com.fsck.k9,9.899999999999999,1,0,Configuration fail After not connecting correctly the manual exchange options were not clear and did not seem to work when they should have. After tracking down some obscure path needed owa\auth\logon.asocials the sync would not enable even after a few settings apparently defaulted off were changed it would not sync. Apparently this lacks push also opting for polling at user defined intervals but I wouldn't know if this actually worked. I might.
com.fsck.k9,5.0,2,0,Poor visual design takes away from the greatness. Maybe its because I am a  graphic designer but this design literally gets worse the more you use this app. I mean it needs a sleeker icon. I ignore bad icons but geeez. This is hideous. Lots of apps have different icons to pick for each apk. It needs something simple and contemperary The gray buttons are not cohesive with the white selection interface and the text is offset. It bugs me a little.
com.fsck.k9,7.7,2,0,This app used to be good on the S7. However now constant sync disable messages show up and are you there have to force close the app or turn off the Wi-Fi and then turn it back on to refresh and get new emails but who wants to keep doing that all day. Also blinking light notification no longer works unless you use sound or vibrate. Due to all of these issues with the application that I can no longer recommend it to anyone until they get fix it
com.fsck.k9,5.35,1,1,"Delete Emails keep coming back. Problem still occurring 5 months after I deleted this app! Why can't the developer fix a simple but annoying problem? I left K9 in July because of a major problem—deleted Emails constantly all come back en masse! It doesn't matter what I do, because every time I delete Emails, whenever new ones arrive, ALL the old deleted ones reappear. I delete them again; they come back again! I've given up on this flawed app."
com.fsck.k9,5.9,2,0,"Unusable. I don't know where to start. I was expecting a working open source client and it's not. Threaded view doesn't work, configuration is a nightmare, but the worst is Battery life. I used to get 1.5 to 2 days of moderate usage out of my G2, now I get about 8h tops, without even using it!!! Keeps the cpu awake like a maniac (I'm talking tens of thousands of wakelocks, every day with only 2 barely used imap accounts). It's just not usable."
com.fsck.k9,8.55,1,3,"Still broken! Loved it, still hate it. It STILL loads old messages in and marks them as unread. This is such a simple thing to sort out... Do you want me to show you how to do it? Also, new interface is boring. Bring the colours back! Much better when it highlighted the email your chosen colour per account, rather than just a rubbish coloured dot. Loads of bugs, can't delete mail anyone because it crashes. HTC Desire, HTC One XL and Galaxy Ace"
com.fsck.k9,5.2,3,0,"Two great features would make 5 star If you could zoom out to 100% to see full sized images that would make this great.  Also, why do I need to know ahead of time if an email is larger than my allowed amount?  Use the shaded email feature for something more useful, like read/unread emails, so it would be easily visable, unlike the little tiny bars which vary slightly in color.  And finally, add swipe down to refresh and download emails please."
com.fsck.k9,4.9,3,0,"Functional and good options I only gave it three stars because, after all my tweaking and setup, I was let down by the lack if a good widget. Seriously all the widget is, is an icon of the Dr. who k9 dog, showing unread count, and only one account. If you have multiple accounts, that's multiple icons. They don't look good and aren't near as usefull as default widget. I mine as well just use the default which displays preview text and subjects."
com.fsck.k9,8.5,1,10,"It finally got so bad I had to go to Blue Mail. It works great. K9 stopped pushing, no notification sound or led.  This was on both the LG G5, and Galaxy S8. K9 just does not work any more. I used it for years then it just crapped out. What happened?  I would love to know how this went from one of the best email apps to one of the worst. Just look at the ratings.  I remember when it had like a 4.8. Now it's junk. Use blue mail. Much better."
com.fsck.k9,7.85,1,5,"4.4 update Just got the new update. Congratulations on completely missing the point of why you started this application in the first place. If you are looking for a gmail program that replaces the bloat of the official version with a whole slew of its own bloat, then K9 is your choice.   If you're looking for a fast, powerful alternative to the email client that came with your phone, then keep looking. K9 has apparently abandoned that idea."

The built-in mail app can connect to my Exchange server fine but will only sync the Inbox.  I could not make this app connect to my Exchange server at all.  The Touchdown app works fine and does what i need.  Unfortunately it costs money but it will be worth the $20 because it works.
com.fsck.k9,9.6,1,0,"No longer a fan - avoid I used to like K9, but due to recent updates, it crashes about 20 times per day, and likely has some memory leaks as it brings my phone to a crawl.

I also submitted a bug regarding the public key crypto support, which never got so much as a reply (*months* ago). I hope this app gets fixed up or goes away. Switching clients."

Nope, after a couple of days use, not fixed.  I'm tired of fighting it.  I really wish it was fixed but I'm wasting my time with it."
com.fsck.k9,3.8,2,0,Good app but lost all archived email The app doesn't walk you through the Archive set up process. If it is not configured by the user you will loose all that you archive due to the fact it creates a Archive folder that is not linked and when you change to link folder or change to different folder it you will loose all in the unlinked Archive folder it created. This issue has been around for many years and they have not addressed it yet 😠
com.fsck.k9,3.85,1,1,"Was this developed by a barrel full of drunken monkeys? That is the only possible explanation for the dreadful interface and generally unpleasant user experience. For example, changing email signatures away from the default product promotion requires a journey through five levels of non intuitive menus, the second of which is only accessible through a press-and-hold action.  I guess you do get your money's worth, which is not very much."
